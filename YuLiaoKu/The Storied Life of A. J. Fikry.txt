PART I

Chapter 1. Lamb to the Slaughter
1953 / Roald Dahl
Wife kills husband with frozen leg
of lamb, then disposes of the
“weapon” by feeding it to the cops.
Serviceable-enough Dahl offering,
though Lambiase questioned whether a
professional
housewife
could
successfully cook a leg of lamb in the
manner
described — i.e.,
without
thawing, seasoning, or marinade.
Wouldn’t this result in tough, unevenly
cooked meat? My business isn’t
cooking (or crime), but if you dispute
this detail, the whole story begins to
unravel. Despite this reservation, it
makes the cut because of a girl I know
who loved James and the Giant Peach
once upon a time.
 — A.J.F.

On the ferry from Hyannis to
Alice Island, Amelia Loman paints
her nails yellow and, while waiting
for them to dry, skims her
predecessor’s notes. “Island Books,
approximately $350,000.00 per
annum in sales, the better portion of
that in the summer months to folks
on holiday,” Harvey Rhodes
reports. “Six hundred square feet of
selling space. No full-time
employees other than owner. Very
small children’s section. Fledgling
online presence. Poor community
outreach. Inventory emphasizes the
literary, which is good for us, but
Fikry’s tastes are very specific, and

without Nic, he can’t be counted on
to hand-sell. Luckily for him,
Island’s the only game in town.”
Amelia yawns — she’s nursing a
slight hangover — and wonders if
one persnickety little bookstore
will be worth such a long trip. By
the time her nails have hardened,
her relentlessly bright-sided nature
has kicked in: Of course it’s worth
it! Her specialty is persnickety little
bookstores and the particular breed
that runs them. Her talents also
include multitasking, selecting the
right wine at dinner (and the
coordinating skill, tending friends
who’ve had too much to drink),

houseplants, strays, and other lost
causes.
As she steps off the ferry, her
phone rings. She doesn’t recognize
the number — none of her friends use
their phones as phones anymore.
Still, she is glad for the diversion
and she doesn’t want to become the
kind of person who thinks that good
news can only come from calls one
was already expecting and callers
one already knows. The caller turns
out to be Boyd Flanagan, her third
online dating failure, who had taken
her to the circus about six months
back.
“I tried sending you a message

a few weeks ago,” he says. “Did
you get it?”
She tells him that she recently
switched jobs so her devices have
been screwed up. “Also, I’ve been
rethinking the whole idea of online
dating. Like whether it’s really for
me.”
Boyd doesn’t seem to hear that
last part. “Would you want to go out
again?” he asks.
Re: their date. For a time, the
novelty of the circus had distracted
from the fact that they had nothing in
common. By the end of dinner, the
greater truth of their incompatibility
had been revealed. Perhaps it

should have been obvious from
their inability to reach consensus on
an appetizer or from his main
course admission that he disliked
“old things” — antiques, houses,
dogs, people. Still, Amelia had not
allowed herself to be certain until
dessert, when she’d asked him
about the book that had had the
greatest influence on his life, and
he’d
replied Principles
of
Accounting, Part II.
Gently, she tells him no, she
would rather not go out again.
She can hear Boyd breathing,
fluttery and irregular. She worries
that he might be crying. “Are you all

right?” she asks.
“Don’t patronize me.”
Amelia knows she should hang
up, but she doesn’t. Some part of
her wants the story. What is the
point of bad dates if not to have
amusing anecdotes for your friends?
“Excuse me?”
“You’ll notice I didn’t call you
right away, Amelia,” he says. “I
didn’t call you because I had met
someone better, and when that
didn’t work out, I decided to give
you a second chance. So don’t be
thinking you’re superior. You’ve
got a decent smile, I’ll give you
that, but your teeth are too big and

so is your ass and you’re not
twenty-five anymore even if you
drink like you are. You shouldn’t
look a gift horse in the mouth.” The
gift horse begins to cry. “I’m sorry.
I’m really sorry.”
“It’s fine, Boyd.”
“What’s wrong with me? The
circus was fun, right? And I’m not
so bad.”
“You were great. The circus
was very creative.”
“But there must be a reason
you don’t like me. Be honest.”
At this point, there are many
reasons not to like him. She picks
one. “Do you remember when I said

I worked in publishing and you said
you weren’t much of a reader?”
“You’re
a
snob,”
he
concludes.
“About some things, I suppose
I am. Listen, Boyd, I’m working. I
have to go.” Amelia hangs up the
phone. She is not vain about her
looks and she certainly doesn’t
value the opinion of Boyd Flanagan,
who hadn’t really been talking to
her anyway. She is just his most
recent disappointment. She has had
disappointments, too.
She is thirty-one years old and
she thinks she should have met
someone by now.

And yet . . .
Amelia
the
bright-sider
believes it is better to be alone than
to be with someone who doesn’t
share your sensibilities and
interests. (It is, right?)
Her mother likes to say that
novels have ruined Amelia for real
men. This observation insults
Amelia because it implies that she
only reads books with classically
romantic heroes. She does not mind
the occasional novel with a
romantic hero but her reading tastes
are far more varied than that.
Furthermore, she adores Humbert
Humbert as a character while

accepting the fact that she wouldn’t
really want him for a life partner, a
boyfriend, or even a casual
acquaintance. She feels the same
way about Holden Caulfield, and
Misters Rochester and Darcy.
The sign over the porch of the
purple Victorian cottage is faded,
and Amelia nearly walks past it.
ISLAND BOOKS
Alice Island’s Exclusive Provider
of Fine Literary Content since
1999
No Man Is an Island; Every Book
Is a World
Inside, a teenager minds the
till while reading the new Alice

Munro collection. “Oh, how is that
one?” Amelia asks. Amelia adores
Munro, but aside from vacation, she
rarely has time to read books that
aren’t on the list.
“It’s for school,” the girl
replies, as if that settles the
question.
Amelia introduces herself as
the sales rep from Knightley Press,
and the teenager, without looking up
from the page, points vaguely to the
back. “A.J.’s in his office.”
Precarious stacks of ARCs and
galleys line the hallway, and
Amelia feels the usual flash of
despair. The tote bag that is

embossing her shoulder has several
additions for A.J.’s piles and a
catalog filled with other books for
her to pitch. She never lies about
the books on her list. She never
says she loves a book if she
doesn’t. She can usually find
something positive to say about a
book or, failing that, the cover or,
failing that, the author or, failing
that, the author’s website. And
that’s why they pay me the big
bucks, Amelia occasionally jokes
to herself. She makes $37,000.00
per year plus the possibility of
bonuses, though no one who does
her job has made a bonus for a very

long time.
The door to A. J. Fikry’s
office is closed. Amelia is halfway
to it when the sleeve of her sweater
catches on one of the stacks, and
one hundred books, maybe more,
crash to the ground with a
mortifying thunder. The door opens,
and A. J. Fikry looks from the
wreckage to the dirty-blond
giantess, who is frantically trying to
repile the books. “Who the hell are
you?”
“Amelia Loman.” She stacks
ten more tomes and half of them
tumble down.
“Leave it,” A.J. commands.

“There’s an order to these things.
You are not helping. Please leave.”
Amelia stands. She is at least
four inches taller than A.J. “But we
have a meeting.”
“We have no meeting,” A.J.
says.
“We do,” Amelia insists. “I emailed you last week about the
winter list. You said it was fine for
me to come by either Thursday or
Friday afternoon. I said I’d come on
Thursday.” The e-mail exchange
had been brief, but she knows it
was not fiction.
“You’re a rep?”
Amelia nods, relieved.

“What publisher again?”
“Knightley.”
“Knightley Press is Harvey
Rhodes,” A.J. replies. “When you
e-mailed me last week, I thought
you were Harvey’s assistant or
something.”
“I’m Harvey’s replacement.”
A.J. sighs heavily. “What
company has Harvey gone to?”
Harvey is dead, and for a
second Amelia considers making a
bad joke casting the afterlife as a
sort of company and Harvey as an
employee in it. “He’s dead,” she
says flatly. “I thought you would
have heard.” Most of her accounts

had already heard. Harvey had been
a legend, as much as a sales rep can
be a legend. “There was an obituary
in the ABA newsletter and maybe
one in Publishers Weekly, too,” she
says by way of apology.
“I
don’t
much
follow
publishing news,” A.J. says. He
takes off his thick black glasses and
then spends a long time wiping the
frames.
“I’m sorry if it’s a shock to
you.” Amelia puts her hand on
A.J.’s arm, and he shakes her off.
“What do I care? I barely
knew the man. I saw him three times
a year. Not enough to call him a

friend. And every time I saw him,
he was trying to sell me something.
This is not friendship.”
Amelia can tell that A.J. is in
no mood to be pitched the winter
list. She should offer to come back
some other day. But then she thinks
of the two-hour drive to Hyannis
and the eighty-minute boat ride to
Alice and the ferry schedule, which
becomes more irregular after
October. “Since I’m here,” Amelia
says, “would you mind if we went
through Knightley’s winter titles?”
A.J.’s office is a closet. It has
no windows, no pictures on the
wall, no family photos on the desk,

no knickknacks, no escape. The
office has books, inexpensive metal
shelves like the kind for a garage, a
filing cabinet and an ancient,
possibly twentieth-century, desktop
computer. A.J. does not offer her a
drink, and although Amelia is
thirsty, she doesn’t ask for one. She
clears a chair of books and sits.
Amelia launches into the
winter list. It’s the smallest list of
the year, both in size and
expectations. A few big (or at least
promising) debuts, but other than
that it is filled with the books for
which the publisher has the lowest
commercial hopes. Despite this,

Amelia often likes the “winters” the
best. They are the underdogs, the
sleepers, the long shots. (It is not
too much of a stretch to point out
that this is how she sees herself,
too.) She leaves for last her favorite
book, a memoir written by an
eighty-year-old man, a lifelong
bachelor who married at the age of
seventy-eight. His bride died two
years after the wedding at the age of
eighty-three. Cancer. According to
his bio, the writer worked as a
science reporter for various
midwestern newspapers, and the
prose is precise, funny, not at all
maudlin. Amelia
had cried

uncontrollably on the train from
New York to Providence. Amelia
knows The Late Bloomer is a small
book and that the description
sounds more than a little cliché, but
she feels sure other people will
love it if they give it a chance. In
Amelia’s experience, most people’s
problems would be solved if they
would only give more things a
chance.
Amelia is halfway through
describing The Late Bloomer when
A.J. puts his head on the desk.
“Is something wrong?” Amelia
asks.
“This is not for me,” A.J. says.

“Just try the first chapter.”
Amelia is pushing the galley into
his hand. “I know the subject matter
could be incredibly corny, but when
you see how it’s writ — ”
He cuts her off, “This is not
for me.”
“Okay, so I’ll tell you about
something else.”
A.J. takes a deep breath. “You
seem like a nice enough young
woman, but your predecessor . . .
The thing is, Harvey knew my
tastes. He had the same taste as
me.”
Amelia sets the galley on the
desk. “I’d like the chance to get to

know your tastes,” she says, feeling
a bit like a character in a porno.
He mutters something under
his breath. She thinks it sounds like
What’s the point? but she isn’t
sure.
Amelia closes the Knightley
catalog. “Mr. Fikry, please just tell
me what you like.”
“Like,” he repeats with
distaste. “How about I tell you what
I don’t like? I do not like
postmodernism,
postapocalyptic
settings, postmortem narrators, or
magic realism. I rarely respond to
supposedly clever formal devices,
multiple fonts, pictures where they

shouldn’t be — basically, gimmicks
of any kind. I find literary fiction
about the Holocaust or any other
major world tragedy to be
distasteful — nonfiction only, please.
I do not like genre mash-ups à la the
literary detective novel or the
literary fantasy. Literary should be
literary, and genre should be genre,
and crossbreeding rarely results in
anything satisfying. I do not like
children’s books, especially ones
with orphans, and I prefer not to
clutter my shelves with young adult.
I do not like anything over four
hundred pages or under one hundred
fifty pages. I am repulsed by

ghostwritten novels by reality
television stars, celebrity picture
books, sports memoirs, movie tie-in
editions, novelty items, and — I
imagine this goes without saying — 
vampires. I rarely stock debuts,
chick lit, poetry, or translations. I
would prefer not to stock series, but
the demands of my pocketbook
require me to. For your part, you
needn’t tell me about the ‘next big
series’ until it is ensconced on the
New York Times Best Sellers list.
Above all, Ms. Loman, I find slim
literary memoirs about little old
men whose little old wives have
died from cancer to be absolutely

intolerable. No matter how well
written the sales rep claims they
are. No matter how many copies
you promise I’ll sell on Mother’s
Day.”
Amelia blushes, though she is
angry more than embarrassed. She
agrees with some of what A.J. has
said,
but
his
manner
is
unnecessarily insulting. Knightley
Press doesn’t even sell half of that
stuff anyway. She studies him. He is
older than Amelia but not by much,
not by more than ten years. He is
too young to like so little. “What do
you like?” she asks.
“Everything else,” he says. “I

will also admit to an occasional
weakness
for
short-story
collections. Customers never want
to buy them though.”
There is only one short-story
collection on Amelia’s list, a debut.
Amelia hasn’t read the whole thing,
and time dictates that she probably
won’t, but she liked the first story.
An American sixth-grade class and
an Indian sixth-grade
class
participate in an international pen
pal program. The narrator is an
Indian kid in the American class
who keeps feeding comical
misinformation about Indian culture
to the Americans. She clears her

throat, which is still terribly dry.
“The Year Bombay Became
Mumbai. I think it will have special
int — ”
“No,” he says.
“I haven’t even told you what
it’s about yet.”
“Just no.”
“But why?”
“If you’re honest with
yourself, you’ll admit that you’re
only telling me about it because I’m
partially Indian and you think this
will be my special interest. Am I
right?”
Amelia imagines smashing the
ancient computer over his head.

“I’m telling you about this because
you said you liked short stories!
And it’s the only one on my list.
And for the record” — here, she lies
 — “it’s completely wonderful from
start to finish. Even if it is a debut.
“And do you know what else?
I love debuts. I love discovering
something new. It’s part of the
whole reason I do this job.” Amelia
rises. Her head is pounding. Maybe
she does drink too much? Her head
is pounding and her heart is, too.
“Do you want my opinion?”
“Not particularly,” he says.
“What are you, twenty-five?”
“Mr. Fikry, this is a lovely

store, but if you continue in this this
this” — as a child, she stuttered and
it occasionally returns when she is
upset; she clears her throat — “this
backward way of thinking, there
won’t be an Island Books before
too long.”
Amelia sets The Late Bloomer
along with the winter catalog on his
desk. She trips over the books in the
hallway as she leaves.
The next ferry doesn’t depart
for another hour so she takes her
time walking back through town.
Outside a Bank of America, a
bronze plaque commemorates the
summer Herman Melville had spent

there, back when the building had
been the Alice Inn. She holds out
her phone and takes a picture of
herself with the plaque. Alice is a
nice enough place, but she imagines
she won’t have reason to be back
anytime soon.
She texts her boss in New
York: Doesn’t look like there’ll be
any orders from Island.
The boss replies: Don’t fret.
Only a little account, and Island
does the bulk of its ordering in
anticipation of the summer when
the tourists are there. The guy who
runs the place is weird, and
Harvey always had better luck

selling the spring/summer list. You
will, too.
AT SIX O’CLOCK, A.J. tells
Molly Klock to leave. “How’s the
new Munro?” he asks.
She groans. “Why does
everyone keep asking me that
today?” She is only referring to
Amelia, but Molly likes to speak in
extremes.
“I suppose because you’re
reading it.”
Molly groans again. “Okay.
The people are, I dunno, too human
sometimes.”
“I think that’s rather the point
with Munro,” he says.

“Dunno. Prefer the old stuff.
See you on Monday.”
Something will have to be
done about Molly, A.J. thinks as he
flips the sign to CLOSED. Aside from
liking to read, Molly is truly a
terrible bookseller. But she’s only a
part-timer, and it’s such a bother to
train someone new, and at least she
doesn’t steal. Nic had hired her so
she must have seen something in the
surly Miss Klock. Maybe next
summer A.J. will work up the
energy to fire Molly.
A.J. kicks the remaining
customers out (he is most annoyed
by an organic chemistry study group

who have bought nothing but have
been camped out in magazines since
four — he’s pretty sure one of them
clogged up the toilet, too), then
deals with the receipts, a task as
depressing as it sounds. Finally, he
goes upstairs to the attic apartment
where he lives. He pops a carton of
frozen
vindaloo
into
the
microwave. Nine minutes, per the
box’s instructions. As he’s standing
there, he thinks of the girl from
Knightley. She had looked like a
time traveler from 1990s Seattle
with her anchor-printed galoshes
and her floral grandma dress and
her fuzzy beige sweater and her

shoulder-length hair that looked like
it had been cut in the kitchen by her
boyfriend. Girlfriend? Boyfriend,
he decides. He thinks of Courtney
Love when she was married to Kurt
Cobain. The tough rose mouth says
No one can hurt me, but the soft
blue eyes say Yes you can and you
probably will. And he had made
that big dandelion of a girl cry.
Well done, A.J.
The scent of vindaloo is
growing stronger, but seven and a
half minutes remain on the clock.
He wants a task. Something
physical but not strenuous.
He goes into the basement to

collapse book boxes with his box
cutter. Knife. Flatten. Stack. Knife.
Flatten. Stack.
A.J. regrets his behavior with
the rep. It hadn’t been her fault.
Someone should have told him that
Harvey Rhodes had died.
Knife. Flatten. Stack.
Someone probably had told
him. A.J. only skims his e-mail,
never answers his phone. Had there
been a funeral? Not that A.J. would
have attended anyway. He had
barely known Harvey Rhodes.
Obviously.
Knife. Flatten. Stack.
And yet . . . He had spent

hours with the man over the last
half-dozen years. They had only
ever discussed books but what, in
this life, is more personal than
books?
Knife. Flatten. Stack.
And how rare is it to find
someone who shares your tastes?
The one real fight they’d ever had
was over David Foster Wallace. It
was around the time of Wallace’s
suicide. A.J. had found the reverent
tone of the eulogies to be
insufferable. The man had written a
decent (if indulgent and overlong)
novel, a few modestly insightful
essays, and not much else.

“Infinite
Jest
is
a
masterpiece,” Harvey had said.
“Infinite Jest is an endurance
contest. You manage to get through
it and you have no choice but to say
you like it. Otherwise, you have to
deal with the fact that you just
wasted weeks of your life,” A.J.
had countered. “Style, no substance,
my friend.”
Harvey’s face had reddened as
he leaned over the desk. “You say
that about any writer who was born
in the same decade as you!”
Knife. Flatten. Stack. Tie.
By the time he gets back
upstairs, the vindaloo is cold again.

If he reheats it in that plastic dish,
he’ll probably end up with cancer.
He takes the plastic tray to the
table. The first bite is burning. The
second bite is frozen. Papa Bear’s
vindaloo
and
Baby Bear’s
vindaloo. He throws the tray against
the wall. How little he had meant to
Harvey and how much Harvey had
meant to him.
The difficulty of living alone
is that any mess he makes he is
forced to clean up himself.
No, the real difficulty of living
alone is that no one cares if you are
upset. No one cares why a thirtynine-year-old man has thrown a

plastic tub of vindaloo across a
room like a toddler. He pours
himself a glass of merlot. He
spreads a tablecloth on the table.
He walks into the living room. He
unlocks a climate-controlled glass
case and removes Tamerlane from
it. Back in the kitchen, he sets
Tamerlane across the table from
him, props it against the chair
where Nic used to sit.
“Cheers, you piece of crap,”
he says to the slim volume.
He finishes the glass. He pours
himself another, and after he
finishes that he promises himself
that he’s going to read a book.

Maybe an old favorite like Old
School by Tobias Wolff, though his
time would certainly be better spent
on something new. What had that
dopey rep been going on about? The
Late Bloomer — ugh. He had meant
what he said. There is nothing
worse than cutesy memoirs about
widowers. Especially if one is a
widower as A.J. has been for the
last twenty-one months. The rep had
been new — not her fault that she
didn’t know about his boring
personal tragedy. God, he misses
Nic. Her voice and her neck and
even her armpits. They had been
stubbly as a cat’s tongue and, at the

end of the day, smelled like milk
just before it curdles.
Three glasses later, he passes
out at the table. He is only five foot
seven inches tall, 140 pounds, and
he hasn’t even had frozen vindaloo
to fortify him. No dent will be made
in his reading pile tonight.
“AJAY,” NIC WHISPERS. “Go to
bed.”
At last, he is dreaming. The
point of all the drinking is to arrive
in this place.
Nic, his drunken-dream ghost
wife, helps him to his feet.
“You’re a disgrace, nerd. You
know that?”

He nods.
“Frozen vindaloo and fivedollar red wine.”
“I am respecting the timehonored traditions of my heritage.”
He and the ghost shuffle to the
bedroom.
“Congratulations, Mr. Fikry.
You’re turning into a bona fide
alcoholic.”
“I’m sorry,” he says. She
lowers him into the bed.
Her brown hair is short,
gamine-style. “You cut your hair,”
he says. “Weird.”
“You were awful to that girl
today.”

“It was about Harvey.”
“Obviously,” she says.
“I don’t like it when people
who used to know you die.”
“That’s why you won’t fire
Molly Klock, too?”
He nods.
“You can’t go on like this.”
“I can,” A.J. says. “I have
been. I will.”
She kisses him on the
forehead. “I guess what I’m saying
is I don’t want you to.”
She is gone.
The accident hadn’t been
anyone’s fault. She’d been driving
an author home after an afternoon

event. She’d probably been
speeding to catch the last
automobile ferry back to Alice.
Possibly she had swerved to avoid
hitting
a
deer.
Possibly
Massachusetts roads in winter.
There was no way to know. The
cop at the hospital asked if she’d
been suicidal. “No,” A.J. said.
“Nothing like that.” She had been
two months pregnant. They hadn’t
told anyone yet. There had been
disappointments before. Standing in
the waiting room outside the
morgue, he rather wished they had
told people. At least there would
have been a brief period of

happiness before this longer period
of . . . He did not yet know what to
c a l l this. “No, she was not
suicidal.” A.J. paused. “She was a
terrible driver who thought she
wasn’t.”
“Yes,” said the cop. “It wasn’t
anyone’s fault.”
“People like to say that,” A.J.
replies. “But it was someone’s
fault. It was hers. What a stupid
thing for her to do. What a stupid
melodramatic thing for her to do.
What a goddamn Danielle Steel
move, Nic! If this were a novel, I’d
stop reading right now. I’d throw it
across the room.”

The cop (who was not much of
a reader aside from the occasional
Jeffery
Deaver
mass-market
paperback while on vacation) tried
to steer the conversation back to
reality. “That’s right. You own the
bookstore.”
“My wife and I,” A.J. replied
without thinking. “Oh Christ, I just
did that stupid thing where the
character forgets that the spouse has
died and he accidentally uses ‘we.’
That’s such a cliché. Officer” — he
paused to read the cop’s badge
 — “Lambiase, you and I are
characters in a bad novel. Do you
know that? How the heck did we

end up here? You’re probably
thinking to yourself, Poor bastard,
and tonight you’ll hug your kids
extra tight because that’s what
characters in these kinds of novels
do. You know the kind of book I’m
talking about, right? The kind of
hotshot literary fiction that, like,
follows
some
unimportant
supporting character for a bit so it
looks all Faulkneresque and
expansive. Look how the author
cares for the little people! The
common man! How broad-minded
he or she must be! Even your name.
Officer Lambiase is the perfect
name for a clichéd Massachusetts

cop. Are you racist, Lambiase?
Because your kind of character
ought to be racist.”
“Mr. Fikry,” Officer Lambiase
had said. “Is there anyone I can call
for you?” He was a good cop,
accustomed to the many ways the
aggrieved can come undone. He set
his hand on A.J.’s shoulder.
“Yes! Right on, Officer
Lambiase, that’s exactly what
you’re supposed to do in this
moment! You’re playing your part
beautifully. Would you happen to
know what the widower is
supposed to do next?”
“Call
someone,”
Officer

Lambiase said.
“Yes, that is probably right.
I’ve already called my in-laws,
though.” A.J. nodded. “If this were
a short story, you and I would be
done by now. A small ironic turn
and out. That’s why there’s nothing
more elegant in the prose universe
than a short story, Officer
Lambiase.
“If this were Raymond Carver,
you’d offer me some meager
comfort and darkness would set in
and all this would be over. But this
. . . is feeling more like a novel to
me after all. Emotionally, I mean. It
will take me a while to get through

it. Do you know?”
“I’m not sure that I do. I
haven’t read Raymond Carver,”
Officer Lambiase said. “I like
Lincoln Rhyme. Do you know
him?”
“The
quadriplegic
criminologist. Decent for genre
writing. But have you read any short
stories?” A.J. asked.
“Maybe in school. Fairy tales.
Or, um, The Red Pony? I think I
was supposed to read The Red
Pony.”
“That is a novella,” A.J. said.
“Oh, sorry. I’m . . . Wait, there
was one with a cop I remember

from high school. Kind of a perfect
crime thing, which I guess is why I
remember it. This cop gets killed by
his wife. The weapon is a frozen
side of beef and then she serves it
to the other — ”
“ ‘Lamb to the Slaughter,’ ”
A.J. said. “The story’s called
‘Lamb to the Slaughter’ and the
weapon is a leg of lamb.”
“Yes, that’s it!” The cop was
delighted. “You know your stuff.”
“It’s a very well-known
piece,” A.J. said. “My in-laws
should be here any minute. I’m
sorry about before when I referred
to you as an ‘unimportant

supporting character.’ That was
rude and for all we know, I am the
‘unimportant supporting character’
in the grander saga of Officer
Lambiase. A cop is a more likely
protagonist than a bookseller. You,
sir, are a genre.”
“Hmmm,”
said
Officer
Lambiase. “You’re probably right
at that. Going back to what we were
talking about before. As a cop, my
problem with the story is the
timeline. Like, she puts the beef — ”
“Lamb.”
“Lamb. So she kills the guy
with the frozen lamb chop then she
puts it in the oven to cook without

even thawing it. I’m no Rachael
Ray, but . . .”
Nic had begun to freeze by the
time they had pulled her car out of
the water, and in the morgue drawer
her lips had been blue. The color
had reminded A.J. of the black
lipstick she’d worn to the book
party she’d thrown for the latest
vampire whatever. He hadn’t cared
for the idea of silly teenage girls
prancing about Island in prom
dresses, but Nic, who had actually
liked that damned vampire book
and the woman who wrote it,
insisted that a vampire prom was
good for business and also fun.

“You remember fun, right?”
“Dimly,” he had said. “Long
ago, back before I was a
bookseller, back when I had my
weekends and my nights to myself,
back when I read for pleasure, I
recall that there was fun. So, dimly,
dimly. Yes.”
“Let me refresh your memory.
Fun is having a smart, pretty, easy
wife with whom you get to spend
every working day.”
He could still picture her in
that ridiculous black satin dress, her
right arm draped around the porch
column and her comely stained lips
in a line. “Tragically, my wife has

been turned into a vampire.”
“You poor man.” She crossed
the porch and kissed him, leaving a
lipstick trace like a bruise. “Your
only move is to become a vampire,
too. Don’t try to fight it. That’s the
absolute worst thing you could do.
You gotta be cool, nerd. Invite me
in.”

Chapter 2. The Diamond as Big as the Ritz
1922 / F. Scott Fitzgerald
Technically, a novella. But then
novella is something of a gray area.
Still, if you find yourself among the
kind of people who bother to make
such distinctions — and I used to be
that type of person — it is best that you
know the difference. (If you end up
going to an Ivy League college,* you
are likely to run into such people. Arm
yourself with knowledge against this
bumptious lot. But I digress.) E. A. Poe
defines a short story as readable in a
single sitting. I imagine a “single
sitting” was longer back in his day.
But I digress again.
Gimmicky, oddball story of the
challenges of owning a town made of

diamonds and of the lengths the rich
will go to protect their way of life.
Fitzgerald is in fine form here. The
Great Gatsby is unquestionably
dazzling, but that novel occasionally
seems overgroomed to me, like a
garden topiary. The short-story format
is a roomier, messier affair for him.
“Diamond”
breathes
like
an
enchanted garden gnome.
Re: its inclusion. Shall I do the
obvious thing and tell you that just
before I met you I too lost something of
great, if speculative, value?
 — A.J.F.
*I have thoughts about this.
Remember that a fine education can be
found in places other than the usual.

Though he can’t remember
how he got there or having taken off
his clothes, A.J. wakes in bed
wearing only his underwear. He
remembers that Harvey Rhodes is
dead; he remembers being an
asshole to the comely Knightley
Press rep; he remembers throwing
the vindaloo across the room; he
remembers the first glass of wine
and the toast to Tamerlane. After
that, oblivion. From his point of
view, the evening had been a
triumph.
His head is pounding. He
walks out to the main room,
expecting to find the vindaloo

detritus. The floor and the walls are
spotless. A.J. digs an aspirin out of
the
cabinet
while
silently
congratulating himself for having
had the foresight to clean up the
vindaloo. He sits down at the
dining-room table and notices that
the wine bottle has also been
thrown out. Odd for him to have
been so fastidious but not
unprecedented. He is nothing if not
a neat drunk. He looks across the
table to where he’d left Tamerlane.
The book is gone. Maybe he only
thought he’d taken it out of the
case?
As he walks across the room,

A.J.’s heart is pounding in
competition with his head. Halfway
to the bookcase, he can see that the
combination-locked,
climatecontrolled glass coffin, which
protects Tamerlane from the world,
is wide open and empty.
He pulls on a bathrobe and
throws on his running shoes, which
haven’t gotten much mileage on
them of late.
A.J. jogs down Captain
Wiggins Street with his dingy plaid
bathrobe flapping out behind him.
He looks like a depressed,
malnourished superhero. He turns
onto Main and runs straight into the

sleepy Alice Island Police Station.
“I’ve
been
robbed!”
A.J.
announces. It was only a short run,
but A.J. is breathing hard. “Please,
someone help me!” He tries not to
feel like an old lady with a stolen
handbag.
Lambiase sets down his cup of
coffee and takes in the distraught
man in the bathrobe. He recognizes
him as the owner of the bookstore
and the man whose pretty young
wife had driven into the lake a year
and a half back. A.J. looks much
older than the last time he’d seen
him, though Lambiase supposes that
is to be expected.

“All right, Mr. Fikry,”
Lambiase says, “tell me what
happened.”
“Someone stole Tamerlane,”
A.J. says.
“What’s Tamerlane?”
“It’s a book. It’s a very
valuable book.”
“To clarify. You mean
someone shoplifted a book from the
store.”
“No. It was my book from my
personal collection. It is an
extremely rare collection of poems
by Edgar Allan Poe.”
“So, it’s, like, your favorite
book?” Lambiase asks.

“No. I don’t even like it. It’s
crap, it’s jejune crap. It’s . . .” A.J.
is hyperventilating. “Fuck.”
“Calm down, Mr. Fikry. I’m
trying to understand. You don’t like
the book, but it has sentimental
value?”
“No! Fuck sentimental value. It
has
great
financial
value.
Tamerlane is like the Honus
Wagner of rare books! You know
what I’m saying?”
“Sure, my pops was a baseball
card collector.” Lambiase nods.
“That valuable?”
A.J. can’t get the words out
fast enough. “It was the first thing

Edgar Allan Poe ever wrote, back
when he was eighteen. Copies are
extremely rare because the print run
was fifty copies, and it was
published anonymously. Instead of
‘by Edgar Allan Poe,’ it says ‘by a
Bostonian’ on the cover. Copies
sell for upward of four hundred
thousand dollars depending on
condition and the mood of the rare
books market. I was planning to
auction it off in a couple of years
when the economy had had a little
time to improve. I was planning to
close the shop and retire on the
proceeds.”
“If you don’t mind my asking,”

Lambiase says, “why would you
keep something like that in your
house and not in a bank vault?”
A.J. shakes his head. “I don’t
know. I was stupid. I liked keeping
it close by, I suppose. I liked being
able to look at it and be reminded
that I could quit anytime I wanted
to. I kept it in a combination-locked
glass case. I thought it was safe
enough.” In his defense, there is
very little theft in Alice Island
except during tourist season. It is
October.
“So, did someone break the
case or did someone know the
combination?” Lambiase asks.

“Neither. I wanted to get
wasted last night. Fucking stupid,
but I took out the book so I could
look at it. A poor excuse for
company, I know.”
“Mr. Fikry, was Tamerlane
insured?”
A.J. puts his head in his hands.
Lambiase takes that to mean that the
book wasn’t. “I only found the book
about a year ago, a couple of
months after my wife died. I didn’t
want to spend the extra money. I
never got around to it. I don’t know.
A million retrospectively idiotic
reasons, the main one being that I
am an idiot, Officer Lambiase.”

Lambiase
doesn’t bother
telling him that it is Chief
Lambiase. “Here’s what I’m gonna
do. First, you and me are gonna file
a police report. Then, when my
detective comes in — she’s only on
half days during the off-season — 
I’m gonna send her down to your
place to look for fingerprints and
other evidence. Maybe something’ll
come up. The other thing we can do
is call the auction houses and other
people who deal in these sorts of
items. If it’s as rare a book as you
say, people will notice if an
unaccounted-for copy comes on the
market. Don’t things like that need

to have a record of who owned
them, a whatchamacallit?”
“A provenance,” A.J. says.
“Yeah, exactly! My wife used
to watch Antiques Roadshow. You
ever seen that show?”
A.J. doesn’t reply.
“One last thing, I’m wondering
who knew about the book?”
A.J. snorts. “Everyone. My
wife’s sister, Ismay, teaches at the
high school. She worries about me
since Nic . . . She’s always bugging
me to get out of the store, get off the
island. About a year ago, she
dragged me to this dreary estate
sale in Milton. It was sitting in a

box with about fifty other books, all
worthless except Tamerlane. I paid
five dollars. The people had no
idea what they had. I felt kind of
shitty about taking it, if you want to
know the truth. Not that it matters
now. Anyway, Ismay thought it
would be good for business and
educational or some crap if I put it
on display in the store. So I kept the
case in the shop all last summer.
You never come to the store, I
guess.”
Lambiase looks at his shoes,
the familiar shame of a thousand
high school English classes where
he’d failed to do the minimum

required reading rushing back to
him. “Not much of a reader.”
“You read some crime, though,
right?”
“Good memory,” Lambiase
says. In fact, A.J. has a perfect
memory for people’s reading tastes.
“Deaver, was it? If you like
that, there’s this new writer from
 — ”
“Sure, I’ll stop by some time.
Is there someone I can call for you?
Your wife’s sister is Ismay EvansParish, right?”
“Ismay’s at — ” At that
moment, A.J. freezes as if someone
has pressed the pause button on

him. His eyes are blank and his
mouth drops open.
“Mr. Fikry?”
For nearly thirty seconds, A.J.
is frozen and then he resumes
speaking as if nothing has
happened. “Ismay’s at work, and
I’m fine. There’s no need to call
her.”
“You were gone for a minute
there,” Lambiase says.
“What?”
“You blacked out.”
“Oh Christ. It’s just an
absence seizure. I used to have
them a lot as a kid. I rarely have
them as an adult except when I’m

unusually stressed.”
“You should see a doctor.”
“No, it’s fine. Honestly. I just
want to find my book.”
“I’d feel better,” Lambiase
insists. “You’ve had a pretty
traumatic morning, and I know you
live alone. I’m gonna take you to the
hospital and then I’m gonna have
your in-laws meet you there.
Meanwhile, I’ll have my guys see if
they can figure anything out about
your book.”
At the hospital, A.J. waits, fills out
forms, waits, strips, waits, takes
tests, waits, puts his clothes back
on, waits, takes more tests, waits,

strips again, and at last is seen by a
middle-aged general practitioner.
She is not particularly concerned
about the seizure. The tests,
however, have revealed that his
blood pressure and cholesterol are
on the border between acceptable
and high for a thirty-nine-year-old
man. She asks A.J. about his
lifestyle. He answers the question
truthfully. “I’m not what you’d call
an alcoholic, but I do like to drink
until I pass out at least once a week.
I smoke occasionally and I subsist
on a diet of frozen entrees. I rarely
floss. I used to be a long-distance
runner, but now I don’t exercise at

all. I live alone and I lack
meaningful personal relationships.
Since my wife died, I hate my work,
too.”
“Oh, is that all?” the doctor
asks. “You’re still a young man,
Mr. Fikry, but a body can only take
so much. If you’re trying to kill
yourself, I can certainly think of
faster, easier ways to go about it.
Do you want to die?”
A
response
doesn’t
immediately occur to him.
“Because if you really want to
die, I can put you under psychiatric
observation.”
“I don’t want to die,” A.J. says

after a bit. “I just find it difficult to
b e here all the time. Do you think
I’m crazy?”
“No. I can see why you would
feel that way. You’re going through
a bear of a time. Start with
exercise,” she says. “You’ll feel
better.”
“Okay.”
“Your wife was lovely,” the
doctor says. “I used to be in the
mother-daughter book club she ran
at the store. My daughter still works
for you part-time.”
“Molly Klock?”
“Klock is my partner’s name.
I’m Dr. Rosen.” She taps her name

tag.
A.J. encounters a
familiar scene. “Would you mind
terribly?” a nurse in pink scrubs
asks, holding out a battered massmarket paperback to a man in a
corduroy jacket with patches on the
elbows.
“I’d be delighted,” Daniel
Parish says. “What’s your name?”
“Jill, like Jack and Jill went
up the hill. Macy, like the store.
I’ve read all your books, but I like
this one the best. Like, by far.”
“That is the popular opinion,
Jill from the hill.” Daniel isn’t
kidding. None of his books have
In the lobby,

sold nearly as well as the first.
“I can’t even express how
much it meant to me. Like, I start to
tear up thinking about it.” She bows
her head and lowers her eyes,
deferent as a geisha. “It’s what
made me want to be a nurse! I just
started working here. When I found
out you lived in town, I kept hoping
you’d come in someday.”
“You mean, you hoped I’d get
sick?” Daniel says, smiling.
“No, of course not!” She
blushes, then swats him on the arm.
“You! You’re terrible!”
“I am,” Daniel replies. “I am,
indeed, terrible.”

The first time Nic had met
Daniel Parish, she had commented
that he had the good looks of an
anchorman for a local news station.
By the car ride home, she had
revised her opinion. “His eyes are
too small for an anchor. He’d be the
weatherman.”
“He does have a sonorous
voice,” A.J. had said.
“If that man told you that the
storm had passed, you would
definitely believe him. Probably
even if you were still standing
smack in the middle of it,” she had
said.
A.J. interrupts the flirtation.

“Dan,” he says. “I thought they’d
called your wife.” A.J. is not going
for subtle.
Daniel clears his throat.
“She’s feeling under the weather, so
I came instead. How you holding
up, old man?” Daniel calls A.J.
“old man” despite the fact that
Daniel is five years older than A.J.
“I’ve lost my fortune, and the
doctor says I’m going to die, but
other than that, I’m fantastic.” The
sedative has given him perspective.
“Great. Let’s get drinks.”
Daniel turns to Nurse Jill and
whispers something in her ear.
When Daniel returns the book to

her, A.J. can see that he has written
his phone number. “Come, thou
monarch of the vine!” Daniel says
as he heads for the exit.
Despite the fact that he loves
books and owns a bookstore, A.J.
does not particularly care for
writers. He finds them to be
unkempt, narcissistic, silly, and
generally unpleasant people. He
tries to avoid meeting the ones
who’ve written books he loves for
fear that they will ruin their books
for him. Luckily, he does not love
Daniel’s books, not even the
popular first novel. As for the man?
Well, he amuses A.J. to an extent.

This is to say, Daniel Parish is one
of A.J.’s closest friends.
“IT’S MY OWN fault,” A.J. says
after his second beer. “Should have
gotten insurance. Should have
stored it in a safe. Shouldn’t have
taken it out when I was drunk. No
matter who stole it, I can’t say my
conduct was exactly faultless.” The
alcohol in combination with the
sedative is mellowing A.J., making
him philosophical. Daniel pours
him another glass from the pitcher.
“Don’t do that, A.J. Don’t
blame yourself,” Daniel says.
“It’s a wake-up call is what it
is,” A.J. says. “I’m definitely gonna

cut down on my drinking.”
“Right after this beer,” Daniel
quips. They clink mugs. A high
school girl in denim cutoffs so short
her buttocks peeks out the bottom
walks into the bar. Daniel holds up
his mug to her. “Nice outfit!” The
girl gives him the finger. “You gotta
stop drinking. I gotta stop cheating
on Ismay,” Daniel says. “But then I
see a pair of shorts like that, and my
resolve is seriously tested. This
night’s been ridiculous. The nurse!
Those shorts!”
A.J. sips the beer. “How’s the
book coming?”
Daniel shrugs. “It is a book. It

will have pages and a cover. It will
have
a
plot,
characters,
complications. It will reflect years
of studying, refining, and practicing
my craft. For all that, it will surely
be less popular than the first one I
wrote at the age of twenty-five.”
“Poor bastard,” A.J. says.
“I’m pretty sure you win the
Poor Bastard of the Year Award,
old man.”
“Lucky me.”
“Poe’s a lousy writer, you
know? And ‘Tamerlane’ is the
worst. Boring Lord Byron rip-off.
It’d be one thing if it were a first
edition of something fucking decent.

You should be glad to be rid of it. I
loathe collectible books anyway.
People getting all moony over
particular paper carcasses. It’s the
ideas that matter, man. The words,”
Daniel Parish says.
A.J. finishes his beer. “You,
sir, are an idiot.”
THE INVESTIGATION LASTS a
month, which in Alice Island PD
time is like a year. Lambiase and
his team find no relevant physical
evidence at the scene. In addition to
throwing out the wine bottle and
cleaning up the vindaloo, the
criminal had apparently wiped
down the apartment of fingerprints.

The investigators question A.J.’s
employees and also his few friends
and relations in Alice. These
interviews result in nothing
particularly incriminating. No book
dealers or auction houses report any
copies of Tamerlane turning up
either. (Of course, auction houses
are notoriously quiet about these
matters.) The investigation is
considered unsolved. The book is
gone, and A.J. knows he will never
see it again.
The glass case, now, has no
use, and A.J. is unsure of what to do
with it. He has no other rare books.
Still, the case had been pricey,

nearly five hundred dollars. Some
vestigial, hopeful part of him wants
to believe that something better
could come along to put in the case.
When he bought it, he was told he
could also use it to store cigars.
As retirement is no longer on
the horizon, A.J. reads galleys,
returns e-mails, answers the phone,
and even writes a shelf talker or
two. At night, after the store is
closed, he starts running again.
There are many challenges to longdistance running, but one of the
greatest is the question of where to
put one’s house keys. In the end,
A.J. decides to leave his front door

unlocked. In his estimation, nothing
here is worth stealing.

Chapter 3. The Luck of Roaring Camp
1868 / Bret Harte
Overly sentimental tale of a mining
camp that adopts an “Ingin baby”
whom they dub Luck. I read it for the
first time at Princeton in a seminar
called the Literature of the American
West and was not moved in the least.
In my response paper (dated
November 14, 1992), the only thing I
found to recommend it were the
colorful character names: Stumpy,
Kentuck, French Pete, Cherokee Sal,
etc. I chanced upon “The Luck of
Roaring Camp” again a couple of
years ago and I cried so much you’ll
find that my Dover Thrift Edition is
waterlogged. Methinks I have grown
soft in my middle age. But me-also-

thinks my latter-day reaction speaks to
the necessity of encountering stories at
precisely the right time in our lives.
Remember, Maya: the things we
respond to at twenty are not
necessarily the same things we will
respond to at forty and vice versa.
This is true in books and also in life.
 — A.J.F.

In the weeks after the robbery,
Island Books experiences a slight
but statistically improbable uptick
in business. A.J. attributes the
increase to the lesser-known
economic indicator known as “the
Curious Townie.”
A well-meaning townie (WMT) will sidle up to the desk. “Any
word on Tamerlane?” [Translation:
May I turn over your significant
personal loss for my own
amusement?]
A.J. will reply, “Nothing yet.”
[Translation: Life still ruined.]
W-MT:
Oh,
I’m
sure
something
will
turn
up.

[Translation: Since I have no
investment in the outcome of this
situation, it costs me nothing to be
optimistic.] What’s new that I
haven’t read?
A.J.: We’ve got a couple
things. [Translation: Pretty much
everything. You haven’t been in
here for months, possibly years.]
W-MT: There was a book I
read about in the New York Times
Book Review. It had a red cover,
maybe?
A.J.: Yeah, that sounds
familiar.
[Translation: That is
excessively vague. Author, title,
description of the plot — these are

more useful locators. That the
cover might have been red and
that it was in the New York Times
Book Review helps me far less
than you might think.] Anything
else you remember about it? [Use
your words.]
A.J. will then lead the W-MT
over to the new release wall, where
he makes sure to sell him or her a
hardcover.
Strangely enough, Nic’s death
had had the opposite effect on
business. Though he had opened
and closed the store with the
emotionless regularity of an SS
officer, the fiscal quarter after her

death had posted the worst sales in
Island’s history. Of course, people
had felt sorry for him then, but they
had felt too sorry for him. Nic had
been a local, one of their own. They
had been touched when the
Princeton graduate (and Alice
Island High School salutatorian no
less) had returned to Alice to open
a bookstore with her serious-eyed
husband. Refreshing to see a young
person coming back home for a
change. Once she died, they found
they had nothing in common with
A.J. except their shared loss of Nic.
Did they blame him? Some of them
did, a little. Why hadn’t he been the

one to drive that author home that
night? They consoled themselves
and whispered that he’d always
been a little odd and — they swore
they didn’t mean this in a racist way
 — a little foreign; it’s obvious the
guy’s not from around here, you
know. (He was born in New
Jersey.) They held their breath as
they walked past the store, like it
was a cemetery.
A.J. runs their credit cards and
concludes that a theft is an
acceptable social loss while a
death is an isolating one. By
December, sales have returned to
their usual, pretheft rate.

TWO

FRIDAYS

BEFORE

Christmas, two minutes before
close, A.J. makes the rounds of
kicking out and ringing up the last
customers. A man in a puffy coat is
hemming and hawing over the latest
Alex Cross. “Twenty-six dollars
seems like a lot. You know I can get
it cheaper online, right?” A.J. says
that he does know as he shows the
man the door. “You should really
lower your prices if you want to be
competitive,” the man says.
“Lower my prices? Lower.
My. Prices. I hadn’t considered that
before,” A.J. says mildly.
“Are you being cheeky, young

man?”
“No, I’m thankful. And at the
next Island Books shareholders’
meeting, I’ll definitely raise this
innovative suggestion of yours. I
know we want to remain
competitive. Between you and me,
for a time in the early oughties,
we’d given up on competition. I
thought it was a mistake, but my
board decided that competition was
best left to Olympic athletes, kids in
spelling
bees,
and
cereal
manufacturers. These days, I’m glad
to report that we at Island Books
are definitely in the competition
business once again. The store’s

closed, by the way.” A.J. points
toward the exit.
As puffy coat grumbles his
way out the door, an old woman
creaks over the threshold. She is a
regular customer, so A.J. tries not
to be too annoyed that she is coming
in after hours. “Ah, Mrs.
Cumberbatch,”
he
says.
“Unfortunately,
we’re
closing
now.”
“Mr. Fikry, don’t you turn
those Omar Sharif eyes of yours on
me. I am outraged at you.” Mrs.
Cumberbatch pushes past him and
slams a plump paperback on the
counter.
“The
book
you

recommended to me yesterday is the
worst book I have read in all my
eighty-two years, and I would like
my money back.”
A.J. looks from the book to the
old woman. “What was your
problem with it?”
“Problems, Mr. Fikry. To
begin, it is narrated by Death! I am
an eighty-two-year-old woman and
I do not find it one bit pleasurable
to read a five-hundred-fifty-twopage tome narrated by Death. I think
it is a remarkably insensitive
choice.”
A.J. apologizes but he is not
sorry. Who are these people who

think a book comes with a guarantee
that they will like it? He processes
the return. The book’s spine is
broken. He will not be able to
resell it. “Mrs. Cumberbatch,” he
cannot resist saying, “it appears that
you read this. I wonder how far
along you got.”
“Yes, I read it,” she replies. “I
most certainly did read it. It kept me
up all night, I was so angry with it.
At this stage of my life, I would
rather not be kept up all night. Nor
do I wish to have my tears jerked at
the rate at which this novel jerked
them. The next time you recommend
a book to me, I hope you’ll keep

that in mind, Mr. Fikry.”
“I will,” he says. “And I do
apologize, Mrs. Cumberbatch. Most
of our customers have rather liked
The Book Thief.”
ONCE THE STORE is closed, A.J.
goes upstairs to change into his
running clothes. He leaves through
the bookstore’s front entrance and,
as has become his custom, does not
lock the door.
A.J. had run cross-country on
his high school’s team and then at
Princeton. He picked up the sport
mainly because he had no skill for
any other sport aside from the close
reading of texts. He never really

considered running cross-country to
be much of a talent. His high school
coach had romantically referred to
him as a reliable middleman,
meaning that A.J. could be counted
on to finish in the upper middle of
any pack. Now that he hasn’t run for
a while, he has to concede that it
had been a talent. In his current
condition, he can’t make it more
than two miles without stopping. He
rarely runs more than five miles
total, and his back, legs, and
basically every part of him hurt.
The pain turns out to be a good
thing. He used to pass his runs by
ruminating, and the pain distracts

him from such a fruitless activity.
Toward the end of his run,
snow begins to fall. Not wanting to
track mud indoors, A.J. stops on the
porch to take off his running shoes.
He braces himself on the front door,
and it swings open. He knows that
he didn’t lock it, but he is
reasonably sure that he didn’t leave
it open. He flips on the light.
Nothing seems out of place. The
cash register doesn’t look molested.
Probably, the wind had blown the
door open. He flips off the light and
is almost to the stairs when he hears
a cry, sharp like a bird’s. The cry
repeats, more insistent this time.

A.J. turns the lights back on.
He walks back to the entrance and
then makes his way up and down
each aisle of the bookstore. He
comes to the last row, the poorly
stocked Children’s and Young
Adult section. On the floor sits a
baby with the store’s lone copy of
Where the Wild Things Are (one of
the few picture books Island even
deigns to carry) in its lap and
opened to the middle. It is a large
baby, A.J. thinks. Not a newborn.
A.J. can’t clock the age because,
aside from himself, he has never
really known any babies personally.
He was the youngest child, and

obviously, he and Nic never had
any of their own. The baby is
wearing a pink ski jacket. She has a
full head of light brown, very curly
hair, cornflower blue eyes, and tancolored skin a shade or two lighter
than A.J.’s own. It’s rather a pretty
thing.
“Who the hell are you?” A.J.
asks the baby.
For no apparent reason, she
stops crying and smiles at him.
“Maya,” she answers.
That was easy, A.J. thinks.
“How old are you?” he asks.
Maya holds up two fingers.
“You’re two?”

Maya smiles again and holds
up her arms to him.
“Where is your mommy?”
Maya begins to cry. She
continues to hold out her arms to
A.J. Because he can’t see his way
to any other options, A.J. picks her
up. She weighs at least as much as a
twenty-four carton of hardcovers,
heavy enough to strain his back. The
baby puts her arms around his neck,
and A.J. notes that she smells rather
nice, like powder and baby oil.
Clearly, this is not some neglected
or abused infant. She is friendly,
well dressed, and expects — nay,
demands — affection. Surely the

owner of this bundle will return at
any moment with an explanation that
makes perfect sense. A brokendown car, say? Or perhaps the
mother was struck with a sudden
case of food poisoning. In the
future, he will rethink his unlockeddoor policy. Though it had occurred
to him that something might be
stolen, he had never considered the
possibility that something might be
left.
She hugs him tighter. Over her
shoulder, A.J. notices an Elmo doll
sitting on the floor with a note
attached to his matted red chest by a
safety pin. He sets the baby down

and picks up Elmo, a character A.J.
has always despised because he
seems too needy.
“Elmo!” Maya says.
“Yes,” A.J. says. “Elmo.” He
unpins the note and hands the baby
the doll. The note reads:
To the Owner of This
Bookstore:
This is Maya. She is
twenty-five months old. She is
VERY SMART, exceptionally
verbal for her age, and a
sweet, good girl. I want her to
grow up to be a reader. I want
her to grow up in a place with
books and among people who

care about those kinds of
things. I love her very much,
but I can no longer take care of
her. The father cannot be in her
life, and I do not have a family
that can help. I am desperate.
Yours,
Maya’s Mother
Fuck, A.J. thinks.
Maya cries again.
He picks up the baby. Her
diaper is soiled. A.J. has never
changed a diaper in his life, though
he is a modestly skilled gift
wrapper. Back when Nic was alive,
Island used to offer free gift wrap at
Christmas, and he figures that

diaper changing and gift-wrapping
must be related proficiencies. Next
to the baby, sits a bag, which A.J.
sincerely hopes turns out to be a
diaper bag. Thankfully, it is. He
changes the baby on the floor of the
store, trying not to dirty the rug or
look at her private parts too much.
The whole thing takes about twenty
minutes. Babies move more than
books and aren’t as conveniently
shaped. Maya watches him with a
cocked head, pursed lips, and a
wrinkled nose.
A.J. apologizes. “Sorry, Maya,
but it wasn’t exactly a pleasure
cruise for me either. The quicker

you stop shitting yourself, the
quicker we don’t have to do this.”
“Sorry,” she says. A.J.
immediately feels awful.
“No, I’m sorry. I don’t know
anything about any of this. I’m an
ass.”
“Ass!” she repeats, and then
she giggles.
A.J. puts back on his running
shoes, and then he hoists up the
baby, the bag, and the note, and
heads for the police station.
OF COURSE, CHIEF Lambiase
would be on duty that night. It
seems to be the man’s lot to be
present for the most important

moments of A.J.’s life. A.J.
presents the baby to the police
officer. “Someone left this in the
store,” A.J. whispers so as not to
wake Maya who has fallen asleep
in his arms.
Lambiase is in the middle of
eating a doughnut, an act he tries to
hide
because
the
cliché
embarrasses him. Lambiase finishes
chewing, then says to A.J. in a most
unprofessional way, “Aw, it likes
you.”
“It’s not my baby,” A.J.
continues to whisper.
“Whose baby is it?”
“A customer’s, I guess.” A.J.

reaches into his pocket and hands
Lambiase the note.
“Oh, wow,” Lambiase says.
“The mother left it for you.” Maya
opens her eyes and smiles at
Lambiase. “Cute little thing, ain’t
she?” Lambiase leans over her, and
the baby grabs his mustache.
“Who’s got my mustache?”
Lambiase says in a ridiculous baby
voice. “Who stole my mustache?”
“Chief Lambiase, I don’t think
you’re showing an adequate amount
of concern here.”
Lambiase clears his throat and
straightens his back. “Okay. Here’s
the thing. It’s nine p.m. on a Friday.

I’ll place a call to the Department
of Children and Families, but with
the snow and the weekend and the
ferry schedule, I doubt anyone will
make it out here until Monday at the
earliest. We’ll try to track down the
mother and also the father, just in
case someone is looking for the
little rascal.”
“Maya,” Maya says.
“Is that your name?” Lambiase
says in his baby voice. “It’s a very
good name.” Lambiase clears his
throat again. “Someone’ll have to
watch the kid over the weekend. I
and some of the other cops could
take turns doing it here, or — ”

“No. It’s fine,” A.J. says.
“Doesn’t seem right to keep a baby
in a police station.”
“Do you know anything about
child care?” Lambiase asks.
“It’s only for the weekend.
How hard can it be? I’ll call my
sister-in-law. Anything she doesn’t
know, I’ll Google.”
“Google,” the baby says.
“Google! That’s a very big
word! Ahem,” Lambiase says.
“Okay, I’ll check back with you on
Monday. Funny world, right?
Someone steals a book from you;
someone else leaves you a baby.”
“Ha,” says A.J.

they arrive at the
apartment, Maya is full-on crying, a
sound somewhere between a New
Year’s Eve party horn and a fire
alarm. A.J. deduces that she is
hungry, but he has no clue what to
feed a twenty-five-month-old. He
pulls up her lip to see if she has
teeth. She does and she uses them to
try to bite him. He Googles the
question: “What do I feed a twentyfive-month-old?” and the answer
that comes back is that most of them
should be able to eat what their
parents eat. What Google does not
know is that most of what A.J. eats
is disgusting. His fridge contains a
BY THE TIME

variety of frozen foods, many of
them spicy. He calls his sister-inlaw Ismay for help.
“Sorry to bother you,” he says.
“But I was wondering what I should
feed
a
twenty-five-month-old
child?”
“Why were you wondering
that?” Ismay asks in a tight voice.
He explains about someone
having left the baby in the store, and
after a pause Ismay says that she
will be right over.
“Are you sure?” A.J. asks.
Ismay is six months pregnant, and
he doesn’t want to disturb her.
“I’m sure. I’m glad you called.

The Great American Novelist is out
of town, and I’ve had insomnia
these last couple of weeks
anyway.”
Less than a half hour later,
Ismay arrives with a bag of
groceries from her kitchen: the
makings of a salad, a tofu lasagna,
and half an apple crumble. “The
best I could do on short notice,” she
says.
“No, it’s perfect,” A.J. says.
“My kitchen is a fiasco.”
“Your kitchen is a crime
scene,” she says.
When the baby sees Ismay, she
bawls. “She must miss her mother,”

Ismay says. “Maybe I remind her of
her mother?” A.J. nods, though he
thinks the real cause is that his
sister-in-law frightens the baby.
Ismay has stylishly cut, spiky red
hair, pale skin and eyes, long,
spindly limbs. All her features are a
little too large, her gestures a little
too animated. Pregnant, she is like a
very pretty Gollum. Even her voice
might be off-putting to a baby. It is
precise, theater-trained, always
pitched to fill the room. In the
fifteen or so years he has known
her, A.J. thinks Ismay has aged like
an actress should: from Juliet to
Ophelia to Gertrude to Hecate.

Ismay warms up the food.
“Would you like me to feed her?”
Ismay asks.
Maya eyes Ismay suspiciously.
“No, I’ll give it a go,” A.J. says. He
turns to Maya. “Do you use
utensils?”
Maya does not reply.
“You don’t have a baby chair.
You’ll need to improvise a
structure so she won’t topple over,”
Ismay says.
He sets Maya on the floor. He
builds three walls out of a pile of
galleys then lines the galley fort
with bed pillows.
His first spoonful of lasagna

goes in without any struggle.
“Easy,” he says.
The second spoonful, Maya
turns her head at the last moment,
sending sauce everywhere — on
A.J., on the bed pillows, down the
side of the galley fort. Maya turns
back to him with a huge smile on
her face, as if she has made the
most fantastically clever joke.
“I hope you weren’t planning
to read those,” Ismay says.
After dinner, they put the baby
to bed on the futon in the second
bedroom.
“Why didn’t you just leave the
baby at the police station?” Ismay

asks.
“Didn’t seem right,” A.J. says.
“You’re not thinking of
keeping it, are you?” Ismay rubs her
own belly.
“Of course not. I’m only
watching it until Monday.”
“I suppose the mother could
turn up by then, change her mind,”
Ismay says.
A.J. hands Ismay the note to
read.
“Poor thing,” Ismay says.
“I agree, but I couldn’t do it. I
couldn’t abandon a child of mine in
a bookstore.”
Ismay shrugs. “The girl

probably had her reasons.”
“How do you know that it’s a
girl?” A.J. asks. “It could be a
middle-aged woman at the end of
her rope.”
“The voice of the letter sounds
young to me, I guess. Maybe the
handwriting, too.” Ismay says. She
runs her fingers through her short
hair. “How are you holding up
otherwise?”
“I’m okay,” A.J. says. He
realizes that he hasn’t thought about
Tamerlane or Nic for hours.
Ismay washes the dishes even
though A.J. tells her to leave it.
“I’m not going to keep her,” A.J.

repeats. “I live alone. I don’t have
much money saved, and business
isn’t exactly booming.”
“Of course not,” Ismay says.
“It wouldn’t make sense with your
lifestyle.” She dries the dishes then
puts them away. “It wouldn’t hurt
you to start eating the occasional
fresh vegetable, however.”
Ismay kisses him on the cheek.
A.J. thinks that she is so like Nic
but so unlike her. Sometimes the
like parts (the face, the figure) seem
hardest for him to bear; sometimes
the unlike parts (the brain, the heart)
do. “Let me know if you need more
help,” Ismay says.

Although Nic had been the
younger sister, she had always
worried about Ismay. From Nic’s
point of view, her older sister had
been a primer on how not to live
her life. Ismay had chosen a college
because she had liked the pictures
in the brochure, had married a man
because he looked splendid in a
tuxedo, and had started teaching
because she’d seen a movie about
an inspirational teacher. “Poor
Ismay,” Nic had said. “She always
ends up so disappointed.”
Nic would want me to be nicer
to her sister, he thinks. “How’s the
production coming?” A.J. asks.

Ismay smiles, and she looks
like a little girl. “My word, A.J., I
wasn’t aware that you even knew
that there was one.”
“The Crucible,” A.J. says.
“Kids come into the store to buy
copies.”
“Yes, that makes sense. Awful
play, really. But the girls get to do a
lot of screaming and yelling, which
they enjoy. Me, less so. I always
come to rehearsal with a bottle of
Tylenol. And maybe in the midst of
all that screaming and yelling, they
accidentally learn a little about
American history. Of course, the
real reason I picked it is because

there are so many female roles — 
less tears when I post the list, you
know. But now, with the baby
coming, it’s starting to seem like,
well, a lot of drama.”
Because he feels obligated to
her for coming over with the food,
A.J. volunteers to help. “Maybe I
could paint flats or print programs
or something?”
She wants to say How unlike
you, but she resists. Aside from her
husband, she believes her brotherin-law to be one of the most selfish
and self-centered men she has ever
met. If one afternoon with a baby
can have such a refining influence

on A.J., imagine what could happen
to Daniel when the baby is born.
Her brother-in-law’s small gesture
gives her hope. She rubs her belly.
It’s a boy in there, and they’ve
already chosen a name and a
backup name if the original name
doesn’t suit.
THE NEXT AFTERNOON, once the
snow has stopped and even begun
to melt away into mud, a body
washes up against the small strip of
land near the lighthouse. The ID in
her pocket says that this is Marian
Wallace, and it does not take long
for Lambiase to deduce that the
body and the baby are, in fact,

related.
Marian Wallace has no people
on Alice, and no one knows why
she was here or who she came to
see or why she decided to kill
herself by swimming into the icy
waters of the Alice Island Sound in
December. That is to say, no one
knows the specific reason. They
know that Marian Wallace is black,
that she is twenty-two years old,
and that she had a twenty-fivemonth-old toddler. To these facts,
they can add what she wrote in her
note to A.J. A flawed but adequate
narrative
emerges.
Law
enforcement concludes that Marian

Wallace is a suicide, nothing more.
As the weekend goes on, more
information about Marian Wallace
emerges. She attended Harvard on
scholarship.
She
was
a
Massachusetts State Champion
swimmer, and an avid creative
writer. She was from Roxbury. Her
mother is dead — cancer when
Marian was thirteen. The maternal
grandmother died a year later of the
same cause. Her father is a drug
addict. She spent her high school
years in and out of foster care. One
of her foster mothers remembers
young Marian always with her head
in a book. No one knows who the

father of her baby is. No one even
remembers her having a boyfriend.
She was put on academic leave
from college because she failed all
her classes the previous semester — 
the demands of motherhood and a
rigorous academic schedule having
become too much to bear. She was
pretty and smart, which makes her
death a tragedy. She was poor and
black, which means people say they
saw it coming.
Sunday night, Lambiase stops
by the bookstore to check on Maya
and give A.J. the update. He has
several younger siblings and he
offers to watch Maya while A.J.

tends to store business. “Do you
mind?” A.J. asks. “Don’t you have
somewhere to go?”
Lambiase is recently divorced.
He had married his high school
sweetheart, so it took him a long
time to realize that she was not, in
fact, a sweetheart or a very nice
person at all. In arguments, she was
fond of calling him stupid and fat.
He is not stupid, by the way, though
he is neither well read nor well
traveled. He is not fat, though he is
built like a bulldog — thick-muscled
neck, short legs, broad, flat nose. A
sturdy American bulldog, not an
English one.

Lambiase does not miss his
wife, though he does miss having
somewhere to go after work.
He parks himself on the floor
and pulls Maya onto his lap. After
Maya falls asleep, Lambiase tells
A.J. the things he’s learned about
the mother.
“What’s strange to me,” A.J.
says, “is why she was on Alice
Island in the first place. It’s kind of
a pain to get here, you know. My
own mother’s visited me once in all
the years I’ve lived here. You
really believe she wasn’t coming to
see someone specific?”
Lambiase shifts Maya in his

lap. “I’ve been thinking about that.
Maybe she didn’t have a plan of
where she was going. Maybe she
just took the first train and then the
first bus and then the first boat and
this is where she ended up.”
A.J. nods out of politeness, but
he doesn’t believe in random acts.
He is a reader, and what he
believes
in
is
narrative
construction. If a gun appears in act
one, that gun had better go off by act
three.
“Maybe she wanted to die
somewhere with nice scenery,”
Lambiase adds. “So the lady from
DCF will be coming to get this little

bundle of joy on Monday. Since the
mother didn’t have any family and
the paternity is unknown, they’ll
have to find a foster home for her.”
A.J. counts the cash in the
drawer. “Kind of rough for kids in
the system, no?”
“It can be,” Lambiase says.
“But this young, she’ll probably do
all right.”
A.J. recounts the cash in the
drawer. “You said the mother had
been through the foster system?”
Lambiase nods.
“Suppose she thought the kid
would stand a better chance in a
bookstore.”

“Who can say?”
“I’m not a religious man, Chief
Lambiase. I don’t believe in fate.
My wife. She believed in fate.”
At that moment, Maya wakes
and holds out her arms to A.J. He
closes the drawer of the cash
register and takes her from
Lambiase. Lambiase thinks he hears
the little girl call A.J. “Daddy.”
“Ugh, I keep telling her not to
call me that,” A.J. says. “But she
won’t listen.”
“Kids get ideas,” Lambiase
says.
“You want a glass of
something?”

“Sure. Why not?”
A.J. locks the front door of the
store and heads up the stairs. He
sets Maya on the futon and goes out
to the main room of the house.
“I can’t keep a baby,” A.J.
says firmly. “I haven’t slept in two
nights. She’s a terrorist! She wakes
up at, like, insane times. Three
forty-five in the morning seems to
be when her day begins. I live
alone. I’m poor. You can’t raise a
baby on books alone.”
“True,” Lambiase says.
“I’m barely keeping myself
together,” A.J. continues. “She’s
worse than a puppy. And a man like

me shouldn’t even have a puppy.
She’s not potty-trained, and I have
no idea how to do that kind of thing
or any of the related matters either.
Plus, I’ve never really liked babies.
I like Maya, but . . . Conversation
with her lacks to say the least. We
talk about Elmo, and I can’t stand
him, by the way, but other than that,
it’s mainly about her. She’s totally
self-centered.”
“Babies do tend to be that
way,” Lambiase says. “The
conversation
will
probably
improve when she knows more
words.”
“And she always wants to read

the same book. And it’s, like, the
crappiest board book. The Monster
at the End of This Book?”
Lambiase says he hasn’t heard
of it.
“Well, believe you me. She’s
got terrible taste in books.” A.J.
laughs.
Lambiase nods and drinks his
wine. “Nobody’s saying you have
to keep her.”
“Yeah, yeah, of course. But do
you think I could have some sort of
say in where she ended up? She’s
an awfully smart little thing. Like
she already knows the alphabet and
I even got her to understand

alphabetical order. I’d hate to see
her land with some jerks who didn’t
appreciate that. As I was saying
before, I don’t believe in fate. But I
do feel a sense of responsibility
toward her. That young woman did
leave her in my care.”
“That young woman was out of
her mind,” Lambiase says. “She
was an hour away from drowning
herself.”
“Yeah.” A.J. frowns. “You’re
right.” A cry from the other room.
A.J. excuses himself. “I should just
go check on her,” he says.
BY THE END of the weekend,
Maya is in need of a bath. Though

he would rather leave such an
intimate activity to the state of
Massachusetts, A.J. doesn’t want to
surrender her to social services
looking like a miniature Miss
Havisham. It takes A.J. several
Google searches to determine
bathing
protocol:
appropriate
temperature bath water two-yearold; can a two-year-old use grownup shampoo?; how does a father go
about cleaning a two-year-old girl’s
private parts without being a
pervert?; how high to fill tub — 
toddler; how to prevent a two-yearold from accidentally drowning in
tub; general rules for bath safety,

and so on.
He washes Maya’s hair with
hemp-based shampoo that used to
belong to Nic. Long after he had
donated or thrown away everything
else of his wife’s, he could not
quite bring himself to discard her
bath products.
A.J. rinses her hair, and Maya
begins to sing.
“What is that you’re singing?”
“Song,” she says.
“What song is that?”
“La la. Booya. La la.”
A.J. laughs. “Yeah, that’s
gibberish to me, Maya.”
She splashes him.

“Mama?” she asks after a
while.
“No, I’m not your mother,”
A.J. says.
“Gone,” Maya says.
“Yes,” A.J. says. “She
probably isn’t coming back.”
Maya thinks about this and
then nods. “You sing.”
“I’d rather not.”
“Sing,” she says.
The girl has lost her mother.
He supposes it’s the least he can
do.
There is no time to Google
appropriate songs for babies.
Before he met his wife, A.J. had

sung second tenor for the Footnotes,
Princeton’s all-male a cappella
group. When A.J. fell for Nic, it
was the Footnotes who had
suffered, and after a semester of
missed rehearsals he had been axed
from the group. He thinks back to
the last Footnotes show, which had
been a tribute to eighties music. For
his bathtub performance, he follows
the program pretty closely,
beginning with “99 Luftballons”
then segueing into “Get out of My
Dreams, Get into My Car.” For the
finale, “Love in an Elevator.” He
only feels mildly foolish.
She claps when he is finished.

“Again,” she commands. “Again.”
“That
show
runs
one
performance.” He lifts her out of the
tub and then he towels her off,
wiping between each perfect toe.
“Luftballon,” Maya says. “Luft
you.”
“What?”
“Love you,” she says.
“You’re clearly responding to
the power of a cappella.”
She nods. “Love you.”
“Love me? You don’t even
know me,” A.J. says. “Little girl,
you shouldn’t go throwing around
your love so easily.” He pulls her
to him. “We’ve had a good run.

This has been a delightful and, for
me, at least, memorable seventytwo hours, but some people aren’t
meant to be in your life forever.”
She looks at him with her big
blue skeptical eyes. “Love you,”
she repeats.
A.J. towels her hair then gives
her head an appraising sniff. “I
worry for you. If you love
everyone, you’ll end up having hurt
feelings most of the time. I suppose,
relative to the length of your life,
you feel as if you’ve known me a
rather long time. Your perspective
of time is really very warped,
Maya. But I am old and soon, you’ll

forget you even knew me.”
Molly Klock knocks on the
door to the apartment. “The woman
from the state is downstairs. Is it
okay for me to send her up?”
A.J. nods.
He pulls Maya into his lap,
and they wait, listening as the social
worker ascends the creaky stairs.
“Now don’t be afraid, Maya. This
lady’s going to find a perfectly
good home for you. Better than
here. You can’t spend the rest of
your life sleeping on a futon, you
know. The kind of people who
spend their lives as permanent
guests on a futon are not the kind of

people you want to know.”
The social worker’s name is
Jenny. A.J. cannot recall ever
having met an adult woman named
Jenny. If Jenny were a book, she
would be a paperback just out of
the box — no dog ears, no
waterlogging, no creases in her
spine. A.J. would prefer a social
worker with some obvious wear.
He imagines the synopsis on the
back of the Jenny story: when
plucky Jenny from Fairfield,
Connecticut, took a job as a social
worker in the big city, she had no
idea what she was getting into.
“Is it your first day?” A.J.

asks.
“No,” Jenny says, “I’ve been
doing this a little while.” Jenny
smiles at Maya. “What a beauty you
are.”
Maya buries her face in A.J.’s
hoodie.
“You two seem very bonded.”
Jenny makes a note in her pad. “So
it’s like this. From here, I’ll take
Maya back to Boston. As her
caseworker, I’ll fill out some
paperwork for her — she obviously
can’t do that herself, ha ha. She’ll
be assessed by a medical doctor
and a psychologist.”
“She seems pretty healthy and

well adjusted to me,” A.J. says.
“It’s good that you’ve
observed that. The doctors will be
on the lookout for developmental
delays, illnesses, and other things
that might not be obvious to the
untrained eye. After that, Maya will
be placed with one of our many
preapproved foster families, and
 — ”
A.J. interrupts. “How does a
foster family get preapproved? Is it
as easy as, say, getting a department
store credit card?”
“Ha ha. No, of course, there
are more steps to it than that.
Applications, home visits — ”

A.J. interrupts again. “What I
mean to say, Jenny, is how do you
make sure you aren’t placing an
innocent child with a complete
psychopath?”
“Well, Mr. Fikry, we certainly
don’t start from the point of view
that everyone who wants to foster a
child is a psychopath, but we do
extensively vet all our foster
families.”
“I worry because . . . well,
Maya’s very bright, but she’s also
very trusting,” A.J. says.
“Bright but trusting. Good
insight. I’ll write that down.” Jenny
does. “So after I place her in an

e me r ge nc y, nonpsychopathic” — 
she smiles at A.J. — “foster family, I
go to work again. I try to see if
anyone in her extended family
wants to claim her and if that’s a
no, I start trying to find a permanent
situation for Maya.”
“You mean adoption.”
“Yes, exactly. Very good, Mr.
Fikry.” Jenny doesn’t have to
explain all this, but she likes to
make Good Samaritans like A.J.
feel like their time has been valued.
“By the way, I really have to thank
you,” she says. “We need more
people like you who are willing to
take an interest.” She holds out her

arms to Maya. “Ready, sweetie?”
A.J. pulls Maya closer to him.
He takes a deep breath. Is he really
going to do this? Yes, I am. Dear
God. “You say that Maya will be
placed in a temporary foster home?
Couldn’t I just as well be that
home?”
The social worker purses her
lips. “All our foster families have
gone through an application
process, Mr. Fikry.”
“The thing is . . . I know it’s
not orthodox, but the mother left me
this note.” He hands the note to
Jenny. “She wanted me to have this
child, you see. It was her last wish.

I think it’s only right that I should
keep her. I don’t want her moved
into some foster home when she has
a perfectly good home right here. I
Googled the matter last night.”
“Google,” says Maya.
“She’s taken a fancy to that
word, I don’t know why.”
“What ‘matter’?” Jenny asks.
“I’m not obligated to turn her
over when it’s the mother’s wish
that I should have her,” A.J.
explains.
“Daddy,” says Maya as if on
cue.
Jenny looks from A.J.’s eyes
to Maya’s. Both sets are annoyingly

determined. She sighs. She had
thought the afternoon would be
simple, but now it’s starting to get
complex.
Jenny sighs again. It is not her
first day, though she only finished
her master’s in social work
eighteen months ago. She is either
bright-eyed
or
inexperienced
enough to want to help them. Still,
he’s a single man, who lives above
a store. The paperwork is going to
be ridiculous, she thinks. “Help me
out here, Mr. Fikry. Tell me you
have a background in education or
child development or some such.”
“Um . . . I was on my way to a

PhD in American literature before I
quit that to open this bookstore. My
specialty was Edgar Allan Poe.
‘The Fall of the House of Usher’ is
a decent primer on what not to do
with children.”
“That’s something,” Jenny says
by which she means it’s something
entirely unhelpful. “You’re sure
you’re up to this? It’s an enormous
financial and emotional and time
commitment.”
“No,” A.J. says, “I’m not sure.
But I think Maya has as good a
chance with me as with anyone
else. I can watch her while I work,
and we like each other, I think.”

“Love you,” Maya says.
“Yes, she keeps saying that,”
A.J. says. “I warned her about
giving love that hasn’t yet been
earned, but honestly, I think it’s the
influence of that insidious Elmo. He
loves everyone, you know?”
“I’m familiar with Elmo,”
Jenny says. She wants to cry. There
is going to be so much paperwork.
And that’s just for the foster
placement. The adoption proper’s
going to be murder, and Jenny will
be the one who has to make the
two-hour trip to Alice Island every
time someone from DCF has to
check on Maya and A.J. “Okay, you

two, I have to call my boss.” As a
girl, Jenny Bernstein, product of
two stable and loving parents from
Medford,
Massachusetts,
had
adored orphan stories like Anne of
Green Gables
and A Little
Princess. She has recently begun to
suspect that the sinister effect of
repeated reading of these stories
was what led her to choose social
work as a profession. In general,
the profession had turned out to be
less romantic than her readings had
led her to believe. Yesterday, one
of
her
former
classmates
discovered a foster mother who had
starved a sixteen-year-old teenage

boy down to forty-two pounds. All
the neighbors had thought the teen
was a six-year-old child. “I still
want to believe in happy endings,”
the classmate had said, “but it’s
getting hard.” Jenny smiles at Maya.
What a lucky little girl, she thinks.
THAT CHRISTMAS AND
for
weeks after, Alice buzzes with the
news that A.J. Fikry the widower /
bookstore owner has taken in an
abandoned child. It is the most
gossip-worthy story Alice has had
in some time — probably since
Tamerlane was stolen — and what
is of particular interest is the
character of A. J. Fikry. The town

had always considered him to be
snobbish and cold, and it seems
inconceivable that such a man
would adopt a baby just because it
was abandoned in his store. The
town florist tells a story about
leaving a pair of sunglasses in
Island Books and coming back less
than one day later to find that A.J.
had thrown them out. “He said his
store had no room for a lost-andfound. And that’s what happens to
very nice, vintage Ray-Bans!” the
florist says. “Can you imagine what
will happen to an actual human
being?” Furthermore, for years, A.J.
had been asked to participate in

town life — to sponsor soccer teams,
to patronize bake sales, to buy ads
in the high school yearbook. The
man had always declined and not
always politely either. They can
only conclude that A.J. has grown
soft since losing Tamerlane.
The mothers of Alice fear that
the baby will be neglected. What
can a single man know about child
rearing? They make it their cause to
stop by the store as often as
possible to give A.J. advice and
sometimes small gifts — old baby
furniture, clothes, blankets, toys.
The mothers are surprised to find
Maya to be a sufficiently clean,

happy, and self-possessed little
person. Only after they’ve left the
store do they cluck about how tragic
Maya’s backstory is.
For his part, A.J. does not
mind the visits. The advice he
mainly ignores. The gifts, he
accepts (though he does liberally
curate and disinfect them after the
women have left). He knows about
the postvisit clucking and decides
not to let it annoy him. He leaves a
jug of Purell on the counter next to a
sign
that
commands PLEASE
DISINFECT BEFORE HANDLING THE

Besides, the women do
actually know a few things that he
INFANTA.

doesn’t know, things about potty
training (bribery works) and
teething (fancy ice-cube trays) and
vaccinations (you can skip the
chicken pox one). It turns out that,
as a source of child-rearing advice,
Google is wide but not, alas,
terribly deep.
While visiting the baby, many
of the women even buy books and
magazines. A.J. begins to stock
books because he thinks the women
will enjoy discussing them. For a
while, the circle responds to
contemporary stories about overly
capable women trapped in troubled
marriages; they like if she has an

affair — not that they themselves
have (or will admit to having had)
affairs. The fun is in judging these
women. Women who abandon their
children are a bridge too far,
although husbands who have
terrible accidents are usually
received warmly (extra points if he
dies, and she finds love again).
Maeve Binchy is popular for a
while, until Margene, who in
another life had been an investment
banker, raises the complaint that
Binchy’s work is too formulaic.
“How many times can I read about
a woman married too young to a
bad, handsome man in a stifling

Irish town?” A.J. is encouraged to
expand his curatorial efforts. “If
we’re going to have this book
group,” Margene says, “we may as
well have some variety.”
“Is this a book group?” A.J.
says.
“Isn’t it?” Margene says. “You
didn’t think all this child-rearing
advice came for free, did you?”
In April, The Paris Wife. In
June, A Reliable Wife. In August,
American Wife. In September, The
Time
Traveler’s
Wife.
In
December, he runs out of decent
books with wife in the title. They
read Bel Canto.

“And it wouldn’t hurt you to
expand the picture-book section,”
Penelope, who always looks
exhausted, suggests. “The kids
should have something to read when
they’re here, too.” The women
bring their own little ones for Maya
to play with, so it only makes sense.
Not to mention, A.J. is tired of
reading The Monster at the End of
This Book, and though he has never
been particularly interested in
picture books before, he decides to
make himself an expert. He wants
Maya to read literary picture books
if such a thing exists. And
preferably modern ones. And

preferably, preferably feminist
ones. Nothing with princesses. It
turns out that these works most
definitely do exist. One night, he
finds himself saying, “As a form,
the picture book has a similar
elegance to the short story. Do you
know what I mean, Maya?”
She nods seriously and turns
the page.
“The talent of some of these
people is astounding,” A.J. says. “I
honestly had no idea.”
Maya taps on the book. They
are reading Little Pea, the story of
a pea who has to eat all his sweets
before he can have vegetables for

dessert.
“It’s called irony, Maya,” A.J.
says.
“Iron,” she says. She makes an
ironing gesture.
“Irony,” he repeats.
Maya cocks her head, and A.J.
decides that he will teach her about
irony some other day.
CHIEF LAMBIASE IS a frequent
visitor to the store, and to justify
these visits, he buys books. Because
Lambiase doesn’t believe in
wasting money, he reads the books,
too. At first, he had mainly bought
mass-market paperbacks — Jeffery
Deaver and James Patterson (or

whoever
writes
for
James
Patterson) — and then A.J. graduates
him to trade paperbacks by Jo
Nesbø and Elmore Leonard. Both
authors are hits with Lambiase, so
A.J. promotes him again to Walter
Mosley and then Cormac McCarthy.
A.J.’s most recent recommendation
is Kate Atkinson’s Case Histories.
Lambiase wants to talk about
the book as soon as he gets to the
store. “So the thing is, at first I kind
of hated the book, but then it grew
on me, yeah.” He leans on the
counter. “Because, you know, it’s
about a detective. But it moves kind
of slow and most things go

unsolved. But then I thought, That’s
how life is. That’s how the job
really is.”
“There’s a sequel,” A.J.
informs him.
Lambiase nods. “Not sure I’m
on board for that yet. Sometimes I
like everything solved. Villains get
punished. Good guys triumph. That
sort of thing. Maybe another one of
those Elmore Leonards, though. Hey
A.J., I’ve been thinking. Maybe you
and me could start a book club for
law enforcement officers? Like,
other cops I know might like
reading some of these stories, and
I’m the chief, so I’d make them buy

books here. It wouldn’t have to only
be cops. It could be law
enforcement enthusiasts, too.”
Lambiase squeezes Purell on his
hands and bends down to pick up
Maya.
“Hey, pretty girl. How you
doing?”
“Adopted,” she says.
“That is a very big word.”
Lambiase looks at A.J. “Hey, is this
square? Did this really happen?”
The process had taken the
average amount of time, concluding
the September before Maya’s third
birthday. The major strikes against
A.J. had included his lack of a

driver’s license (he had never
gotten one on account of his
seizures) and, of course, the fact
that he is a single man who had
never raised a child or even a dog
or a houseplant. Ultimately, A.J.’s
education, his strong ties to the
community (i.e., the bookstore), and
the fact that the mother had wanted
Maya to be placed with him had
outweighed the strikes.
“Congratulations
to
my
favorite book people!” Lambiase
says. He throws Maya in the air,
then catches her and sets her on the
ground. He leans across the counter
to shake A.J.’s hand. “Naw. I gotta

hug you, man. This is hug-worthy
news,” the cop says. Lambiase
moves behind the counter to
embrace A.J.
“Let’s have a toast,” A.J. says.
A.J. hoists Maya to his hip,
and the two men go upstairs. A.J.
puts Maya to bed, which takes
forever (the intricate affairs of her
toilet and two entire picture books),
and Lambiase gets the bottle
started.
“You gonna christen her
now?” Lambiase asks.
“I’m neither Christian nor
particularly religious,” A.J. says.
“So no.”

Lambiase
considers
this,
drinks a bit more wine. “You didn’t
ask for my two cents, but you ought
to at least have a party to introduce
her to people. She’s Maya Fikry
now, right?”
A.J. nods.
“People should know this. You
gotta give her a middle name, too.
Plus, I think I ought to be her
godfather,” Lambiase says.
“What would that entail
exactly?”
“Well, let’s say the kid’s
twelve and she gets caught
shoplifting at the CVS. I’d probably
use my influence to intervene.”

“Maya would never do that.”
“That’s what all parents
think,” Lambiase says. “Basically,
I’d be your backup, A.J. People
should have backups.” Lambiase
finishes off his glass. “I’d help you
with the party.”
“What would a not-christening
party entail?” A.J. asks.
“It’s not a big deal. You have
it in the store. You buy Maya a new
dress from Filene’s Basement. I bet
Ismay can help with that. You get
food from Costco. Those big
muffins, maybe? My sister says
they’ve got a thousand calories a
piece. And some frozen stuff. Nice

stuff. Coconut shrimp. A big hunk of
Stilton. And since it’s not going to
be Christian — ”
A.J. interrupts. “For the
record, it’s not going to be unChristian either.”
“Right. My point is you can
serve booze. And we invite your
brother-in-law and sister-in-law
and those ladies you hang out with
and everyone else who has taken an
interest in little Maya, which I’ll
tell you, A.J., is just about the
whole town. And I’d say some nice
words as the godfather, if you
decide to go that way. Not a prayer,
’cause I know you’re not into that.

But you know I’d wish the little girl
well on this journey we call life.
And you’d thank everyone for
coming. We all raise a glass to
Maya. Everyone goes home happy.”
“So it’s basically like a book
party.”
“Yeah, sure.” Lambiase has
never been to a book party.
“I hate book parties,” A.J.
says.
“But you run the bookstore,”
Lambiase says.
“It’s a problem,” A.J. admits.
MAYA’S

NOT-CHRISTENING

is held the week before
Halloween. Aside from several of
PARTY

the children in attendance wearing
Halloween costumes, the party is
indistinguishable from either a
christening christening or a book
party. A.J. watches Maya in her
pink party dress, and he feels a
vaguely
familiar,
slightly
intolerable bubbling inside of him.
He wants to laugh out loud or punch
a wall. He feels drunk or at least
carbonated. Insane. At first, he
thinks this is happiness, but then he
determines it’s love. Fucking love,
he thinks. What a bother. It’s
completely gotten in the way of his
plan to drink himself to death, to
drive his business to ruin. The most

annoying thing about it is that once a
person gives a shit about one thing,
he finds he has to start giving a shit
about everything.
No, the most annoying thing
about it is that he’s even started to
like Elmo. There are Elmo paper
plates on the folding table with the
coconut shrimp, and A.J. had
blithely gone to multiple stores to
procure them. Across the room in
Best Sellers, Lambiase is giving a
speech that consists of clichés,
albeit heartfelt and applicable ones:
how A.J. has turned lemons into
lemonade, how Maya is a silverlined cloud, how God’s closed

door / open window policy really
does apply here, and so forth. He
smiles at A.J., and A.J. raises his
glass and smiles back. And then,
despite the fact that A.J. does not
believe in God, he closes his eyes
and thanks whomever, the higher
power, with all his porcupine heart.
Ismay, A.J.’s choice for
godmother, grabs his hand. “Sorry
to abandon you, but I’m not feeling
well,” she says.
“Was it Lambiase’s speech?”
A.J. says.
“I might be getting a cold. I’m
going home.”
A.J. nods. “Call me later,

okay?”
It is Daniel who calls later.
“Ismay’s in the hospital,” he says
flatly. “Another miscarriage.”
That makes two in the last
year, five total. “How is she?” A.J.
asks.
“She’s lost some blood and
she’s tired. She’s a sturdy old mare,
though.”
“She is.”
“It’s a bad business allaround, but unfortunately,” Daniel
says, “I’ve got to catch an early
flight to Los Angeles. The movie
people are buzzing.” The movie
people are always buzzing in

Daniel’s stories, though none of
them ever seem to sting. “Would
you mind going to check on her at
the hospital, make sure she gets
home all right?”
Lambiase drives A.J. and
Maya to the hospital. A.J. leaves
Maya in the waiting room with
Lambiase and goes in to see Ismay.
Her eyes are red; her skin,
pale. “I’m sorry,” she says when
she sees A.J.
“For what, Ismay?”
“I deserve this,” she says.
“You don’t,” A.J. says. “You
shouldn’t say that.”
“Daniel’s an asshole for

making you come out,” Ismay says.
“I was glad to,” A.J. says.
“He cheats on me. Do you
know that? He cheats on me all the
time.”
A.J. doesn’t say anything, but
he
does
know.
Daniel’s
philandering is not a secret.
“Of course you know,” Ismay
says in a husky voice. “Everyone
knows.”
A.J. says nothing.
“You do know, but you won’t
talk about it. Some misguided male
code, I suppose.”
A.J. looks at her. Her
shoulders are bony under the

hospital gown, but her abdomen is
still slightly round.
“I look a mess,” she says.
“That’s what you’re thinking.”
“No, I was noticing that you’re
growing out your hair. It’s nice that
way.”
“You’re sweet,” she says. At
that moment, Ismay sits up and tries
to kiss A.J. on the mouth.
A.J. leans away from her.
“The doctor says you can go home
right now if you’d like.”
“I thought my sister was an
idiot when she married you, but
now I see you’re not that bad. The
way you are with Maya. The way

you are now, showing up. Showing
up is what counts, A.J.
“I think I’d rather stay here
tonight,” she says, flipping away
from A.J. “There’s no one at my
house, and I don’t want to be that
alone. What I said before is true.
Nic was the good girl. I’m bad. I
married a bad man, too. And I know
that bad people deserve what they
get, but oh, how we hate to be
alone.”

Chapter 4. What Feels Like the World
1985 / Richard Bausch
Chubby girl lives with grandfather;
trains
for
elementary
school
gymnastics exhibition.
You will be amazed by how much
you care whether that little girl makes
it over the vault. Bausch is able to
wring exquisite tension from such a
seemingly slight episode (though
obviously this is the point), and this
should be your takeaway: a vaulting
exhibition can have every bit as much
drama as a plane crash.
I did not encounter this story until
after I became a father so I cannot say
if I would have liked it as well P.M.
(pre-Maya). I have gone through
phases in my life when I am more in

the mood for short stories. One of
those phases coincided with your
toddlerhood — what time had I for
novels, my girl?
 — A.J.F.

Maya usually wakes before the
sun comes up, when the only sound
is A.J. snoring in the other room. In
footed pajamas, she pads across the
main room to A.J.’s bedroom. At
first, she whispers, “Daddy,
Daddy.” If that doesn’t work, she
says his name and if that still
doesn’t work, she yells it. And if
words are not enough, she jumps on
the bed, though she would rather not
resort to such shenanigans. Today
he wakes when she has only
reached talking level. “Awake,” she
says. “Downstairs.”
The place Maya loves most is
downstairs because downstairs is

the store, and the store is the best
place in the world.
“Pants,”
A.J.
mumbles.
“Coffee.” His breath smells like
socks wet from snow.
There are sixteen stairs until
you get to the bookstore. Maya
slides her bottom down each one
because her legs are too short to
manage the flight with confidence.
She toddles across the store, past
the books that don’t have pictures in
them, past the greeting cards. She
runs her hand across the magazines,
gives the rotating stand with the
bookmarks a spin. Good morning,
magazines!
Good
morning,

bookmarks! Good morning, books!
Good morning, store!
The walls of the bookstore
have wood panels up to just above
her head, but beyond that is blue
wallpaper. Maya can’t reach the
paper unless she has a chair. The
wallpaper has a bumpy, swirling
pattern, and it is pleasing to rub her
face against it. She will read the
word damask in a book one day and
think, Yes, of course that’s what
it’s called. In contrast, the word
wainscoting will come as a huge
disappointment.
The store is fifteen Mayas
wide and twenty Mayas long. She

knows this because she once spent
an afternoon measuring it by lying
her body across the room. It is
fortunate that it is not more than
thirty Mayas long because that is as
far as she could count on the day the
measurements were taken.
From her vantage point on the
floor, people are shoes. In the
summer, sandals. In the winter,
boots. Molly Klock sometimes
wears red superhero boots up to her
knees. A.J. is black sneakers with
white toes. Lambiase wears fingercrushing Bigfoot shoes. Ismay
wears flats that look like insects or
jewels. Daniel Parish wears brown

loafers with a penny in them.
Just before the store opens at
10 a.m., she goes to her station,
which is the row with all the
picture books.
The
first
way
Maya
approaches a book is to smell it.
She strips the book of its jacket,
then holds it up to her face and
wraps the boards around her ears.
Books typically smell like Daddy’s
soap, grass, the sea, the kitchen
table, and cheese.
She studies the pictures and
tries to tease story out of them. It is
tiring work, but even at three years
old, she recognizes some of the

tropes. For instance, animals are
not always animals in picture
books. They sometimes represent
parents and children. A bear
wearing a tie might be a father. A
bear with a blond wig might be a
mother. You can tell a lot about a
story from the pictures, but the
pictures sometimes give you the
wrong idea. She would prefer to
know the words.
Assuming no interruptions, she
can make it through seven books in
a morning. However, there are
always interruptions. Maya mainly
likes customers, though, and tries to
be polite to them. She understands

the business she and A.J. are in.
When children come into her row,
she always makes sure to stick a
book into their hands. The children
wander up to the cash register, and
more
often
than
not
the
accompanying guardian will buy
what the child is holding. “Oh my,
did you pick that yourself?” the
parent will ask.
Once, someone had asked A.J.
if Maya was his. “You’re both
black but not the same kind of
black.” Maya remembers this
because the remark had made A.J.
use a tone of voice she had never
heard him use with a customer.

“What is the same kind of
black?” A.J. had asked.
“No, I didn’t mean to offend
you,” the person had said and then
the flip flops had backed their way
to the door, leaving without making
a purchase.
Wha t is “the same kind of
black”? She looks at her hands and
wonders.
Here are some other things she
wonders about.
How do you learn to read?
Why do grown-ups like books
without pictures?
Will Daddy ever die?
What is for lunch?

one and
comes from the sandwich shop. She
has grilled cheese. A.J. has a turkey
club. She likes to go to the
sandwich shop, but she always
holds A.J.’s hand. She would not
want to be left in a sandwich shop.
In the afternoon, she draws
reviews. An apple means the
book’s smell is approved. A block
of cheese means the book is ripe. A
self-portrait means she likes the
pictures. She signs these reports
MAYA and passes them on to A.J.
for his approval.
She likes to write her name.
MAYA.
LUNCH IS AROUND

She knows her last name is
Fikry, but she doesn’t know how to
write that yet.
Sometimes, after the customers
and the employees have left, she
thinks that she and A.J. are the only
people in the world. No one else
seems as real as he does. Other
people are shoes for different
seasons, nothing more. A.J. can
touch the wallpaper without getting
on a chair, can operate the cash
register while talking on the phone,
can lift heavy boxes of books over
his head, uses impossibly long
words, knows everything about
everything. Who could compare to

A. J. Fikry?
She does not think of her
mother almost ever.
She knows that her mother is
dead. And she knows that dead is
when you go to sleep and you do
not wake up. She feels very sorry
for her mother because people who
don’t wake up can’t go downstairs
to the bookstore in the morning.
Maya knows that her mother
left her in Island Books. But maybe
that’s what happens to all children
at a certain age. Some children are
left in shoe stores. And some
children are left in toy stores. And
some children are left in sandwich

shops. And your whole life is
determined by what store you get
left in. She does not want to live in
the sandwich shop.
Later, when she is older, she
will think about her mother more.
In the evening, A.J. changes
his shoes, then puts her in a stroller.
It is getting to be a tight fit, but she
likes the ride so she tries not to
complain. She likes hearing A.J.
breathing. And she likes seeing the
world moving by so fast. And
sometimes,
he
sings.
And
sometimes he tells her stories. He
tells her how he had a book called
Tamerlane once and it was worth

as much as all the books in the store
combined.
Tamerlane, she says, liking the
mystery and the music of the
syllables.
“And that is how you got your
middle name.”
At night, A.J. tucks her in bed.
She does not like to go to bed even
if she is tired. The offer of a story is
the best way for A.J. to persuade
her to sleep. “Which one?” he says.
He’s been nagging her to stop
choosing The Monster at the End
of This Book, so she pleases him by
saying, “Caps for Sale.”
She has heard the story before,

but she can’t make sense of it. It is
about a man who sells colorful hats.
He takes a nap, and his hats get
stolen by monkeys. She hopes this
will never happen to A.J.
Maya is furrowing her brow,
clutching A.J.’s arm.
“What is it?” A.J. asks.
Why do monkeys want hats?
Maya wonders. Monkeys are
animals. Maybe the monkeys, like
the bear in the wig who is a mother,
represent something else, but what .
. . ? She has thoughts but not words.
“Read,” she says.
Sometimes A.J. has a woman
come to the store to read books

aloud to Maya and the other
children. The woman gesticulates
and mugs, raising and lowering her
voice for dramatic effect. Maya
wants to tell her to relax. She is
used to the way A.J. reads — soft
and low. She is used to him.
A.J. reads, “. . . on the very
top, a bunch of red caps.”
The picture shows a man in
many colored caps.
Maya puts her hand over
A.J.’s to stop him from turning the
page just yet. She scans her eyes
from the picture to the page and
back again. All at once, she knows
that r-e-d is red, knows it like she

knows her name is Maya, like she
knows A. J. Fikry is her father, like
she knows the best place in the
world is Island Books.
“What is it?” he asks.
“Red,” she says. She takes his
hand and moves it so it is pointing
to the word.

Chapter 5. A Good Man Is Hard to Find
1953 / Flannery O’Connor
Family trip goes awry. It’s Amy’s
favorite. (She seems so sweet on the
surface, no?) Amy and I do not always
have the exact same taste in things, but
this I like.
When she told me it was her
favorite, it suggested to me strange
and wonderful things about her
character that I had not guessed, dark
places that I might like to visit.
People tell boring lies about
politics, God, and love. You know
everything you need to know about a
person from the answer to the
question, What is your favorite book?
 — A.J.F.

The second week of August,
just
before
Maya
starts
kindergarten, she gets a matching
set of glasses (round, red frames)
and chicken pox (round, red
bumps). A.J. curses the mother who
had told him that the chicken pox
vaccine was optional as the chicken
pox is indeed a pox on their house.
Maya is miserable, and A.J. is
miserable because Maya is
miserable. The marks plague her
face, and the air conditioner breaks,
and no one in their house can sleep.
A.J. brings her icy washcloths,
removes skin from tangerine slices,
puts socks on her hands, and stands

guard at her bedside.
Day three, four in the morning,
Maya falls asleep. A.J. is exhausted
but restless. He had asked one of
the clerks to grab a couple of
galleys from the basement for him.
Unfortunately, the clerk is new, and
she had picked books from the TO
BE RECYCLED pile, not the TO BE
READ pile. A.J. doesn’t want to
leave Maya’s side so he decides to
read one of the old, rejected
galleys. The top one in the pile is a
young-adult fantasy novel in which
the main character is dead. Ugh,
A.J. thinks. Two of his least
favorite
things
(postmortem

narrators and young-adult novels) in
one book. He tosses the paper
carcass aside. The second one in
the pile is a memoir written by an
eighty-year-old man, a lifelong
bachelor and onetime science
writer for various midwestern
newspapers, who married at the age
of seventy-eight. His bride died two
years after the wedding at the age of
eighty-three. The Late Bloomer by
Leon Friedman. The book is
familiar to A.J., but he’s not sure
why. He opens the galley and a
business card falls out: AMELIA
LOMAN, KNIGHTLEY PRESS . Yes, he
remembers now.

Of course, he has encountered
Amelia Loman in the years since
that awkward first meeting. They
have had a handful of cordial emails, and she comes trianually to
report on Knightley’s hottest
prospects. After spending ten or so
afternoons with her, he’s recently
come to the conclusion that she is
good at her job. She is informed
about her list and greater literary
trends. She is upbeat but not an
overseller. She is sweet with Maya,
too — always remembers to bring
the girl a book from one of
Knightley’s children’s lines. Above
all, Amelia Loman is professional,

which means she has never brought
up A.J.’s poor conduct the day they
met. God, he’d been awful to her.
As penance, he decides to give The
Late Bloomer a chance, though it is
still not his type of thing.
“I am eighty-one years old,
and statistically speaking, I should
have died 4.7 years ago,” the book
begins.
At 5 a.m., A.J. closes the book
and gives it a pat.
Maya wakes, feeling better.
“Why are you crying?”
“I was reading,” A.J. says.
SHE DOESN’T RECOGNIZE the
number, but Amelia Loman picks up

on the first ring.
“Amelia, hello. This is A. J.
Fikry from Island. I wasn’t
expecting you to answer.”
“It’s true,” she says, laughing.
“I’m the last person left in the entire
world who still answers her
phone.”
“Yes,” he says, “you might
be.”
“The Catholic church is
thinking of making me a saint.”
“Saint Amelia who answered
the phone,” A.J. says.
He has never called her
before, and she assumes this must
be the reason. “Are we still on for

two weeks from now, or do you
have to cancel?” Amelia asks.
“Oh no, nothing like that. I was
just planning to leave you a
message, actually.”
Amelia speaks in monotone.
“Hi, you’ve reached the voice mail
of Amelia Loman. Beep.”
“Um.”
“Beep,” Amelia repeats. “Go
ahead. Leave your message.”
“Um, hi, Amelia. This is A. J.
Fikry. I’ve just finished reading a
book you recommended to me — ”
“Oh yeah, which one?”
“That’s odd. Voice mail seems
to be talking back to me. It’s one

from several years back. The Late
Bloomer by Leon Friedman.”
“Don’t go breaking my heart,
A.J. That was my absolute favorite
from four winter lists ago. No one
wanted to read it. I loved that book.
I still love that book! I’m the queen
of lost causes, though.”
“Maybe it was the jacket,”
A.J. says lamely.
“Lamentable
jacket.
Old
people’s feet, flowers,” Amelia
agrees. “Like anyone wants to think
about wrinkly old feet let alone buy
a book with them on it. Paperback
re-jacket didn’t help anything either
 — black and white, more flowers.

But jackets are the redheaded
stepchildren of book publishing.
We blame them for everything.”
“I don’t know if you
remember, but you gave The Late
Bloomer to me the first time we
met,” A.J. says.
Amelia pauses. “Did I? Yes,
that makes sense. That would have
been around the time I started at
Knightley.”
“Well, you know, literary
memoirs aren’t really my thing, but
this was just spectacular in its small
way. Wise and . . .” He feels naked
when speaking about things he
really loves.

“Go on.”
“Every word the right one and
exactly where it should be. That’s
basically the highest compliment I
can give. I’m only sorry it took me
so long to read it.”
“Story of my life. What made
you finally pick it up?”
“My little girl was sick, so — ”
“Oh, poor Maya! I hope
nothing serious!”
“Chicken pox. I was up all
night with her, and it was the book
nearest to me at the time.”
“I’m glad you finally read it,”
Amelia says. “I begged everyone I
knew to read this book, and no one

would listen except my mother and
even she wasn’t an easy sell.”
“Sometimes books don’t find
us until the right time.”
“Not much consolation for Mr.
Friedman,” Amelia adds.
“Well, I’m going to order a
carton of the equally lamentably
jacketed paperback. And in the
summer, when all the tourists are
here, maybe we could have Mr.
Friedman in for an event.”
“If he lives that long,” Amelia
says.
“Is he sick?” A.J. asks.
“No, but he’s, like, ninety!”
A.J. laughs. “Well, Amelia,

I’ll see you in two weeks, I guess.”
“Maybe next time you’ll listen
to me when I tell you something’s
the ‘best book of the winter list’!”
Amelia says.
“Probably not. I’m old, set in
my ways, contrary.”
“You’re not that old,” she
says.
“Not compared to Mr.
Friedman, I suppose.” A.J. clears
his throat. “When you’re in town,
maybe we could have dinner or
something.”
It isn’t at all uncommon for
sales reps and booksellers to break
bread, but Amelia detects a certain

tone in A.J.’s voice. She clarifies.
“We can go over the new winter
list.”
“Yes, of course,” A.J. answers
too quickly. “It’s such a long trip
for you to Alice. You’ll be hungry.
It’s rude that I’ve never suggested it
before.”
“Let’s make it a late lunch,
then,” Amelia says. “I need to catch
the last ferry back to Hyannis.”
A.J. DECIDES TO take Amelia to
Pequod’s, which is the second
nicest seafood restaurant on Alice
Island. El Corazon, the nicest
restaurant, is not open for lunch,
and even if it had been, El Corazon

would have seemed too romantic
for what is only a business meeting.
A.J. arrives first, which gives
him time to regret his choice. He
has not been to Pequod’s since
before Maya, and its decor strikes
him as embarrassing and touristy.
The tasteful white table linens do
not much distract from the
harpoons, nets, and raincoats
hanging from the walls, or the
captain, carved out of a log, who
welcomes you with a bucket of
complimentary saltwater taffy. A
fiberglass whale with tiny, sad eyes
is mounted from the ceiling. A.J.
senses the whale’s judgment:

Should have gone with El Corazon,
matey.
Amelia is five minutes late.
“Pequod, like Moby Dick,” she
says. She is wearing a dress made
out of what looks like a repurposed
crocheted tablecloth over a vintage
pink slip. She has a fake daisy in
her curly blond hair and is wearing
galoshes despite the fact that the
day is sunny. A.J. thinks the
galoshes make her seem like a Boy
Scout, in a state of readiness and
prepared for disaster.
“Do you like Moby Dick?” he
asks.
“I hate it,” she says. “And I

don’t say that about many things.
Teachers assign it, and parents are
happy because their kids are
reading something of ‘quality.’ But
it’s forcing kids to read books like
that that make them think they hate
reading.”
“I’m surprised you didn’t
cancel when you saw the name of
the restaurant.”
“Oh, I thought about it,” she
says with mirth in her voice. “But
then I reminded myself that it’s just
a restaurant name and it probably
won’t effect the quality of the food
too, too much. Plus I looked up the
reviews online, and it sounded

delicious.”
“You didn’t trust me?”
“I like to think about what I’m
going to eat before I get there. I like
to” — she stretches out the word
 — “an-ti-ci-pate.” She opens the
menu. “I see they’ve got several
cocktails named after Moby Dick
characters.” She turns the page.
“Anyway, if I hadn’t wanted to eat
here, I probably would have
invented an allergy to shellfish.”
“Fictional food allergy. That’s
very devious of you,” A.J. says.
“Now I won’t be able to use
that trick with you.”
The waiter is dressed in a

puffy white shirt that is clearly in
conflict with his black glasses and
fauxhawk. The look is pirate
hipster. “Ahoy, landlubbers,” the
waiter says flatly. “Try a themed
cocktail?”
“My standard drink is the oldfashioned, but how can a person be
expected to resist a themed
cocktail?”
she
says.
“One
Queequeg, please.” She grabs the
waiter’s hand. “Wait. Is it good?”
“Um,” the waiter says. “The
tourists seem to like them.”
“Well, if the tourists like
them,” she says.
“Um, so I’m clear, does that

mean you do or you don’t want the
cocktail?”
“I definitely want it,” Amelia
says. “Come what may.” She smiles
at the waiter. “I won’t blame you if
it’s terrible.”
A.J. orders a glass of the
house red.
“That’s sad,” Amelia says. “I
bet you’ve gone your whole life
without having a Queequeg despite
the fact that you live here and you
sell books and you probably even
like Moby Dick.”
“You’re obviously a more
evolved person than I am,” A.J.
says.

“Yes, I can see that. And after
I have this cocktail, my whole life’s
probably going to change.”
The drinks arrive. “Oh, look,”
Amelia says. “A shrimp with a little
harpoon through it. That is an
unexpected delight.” She takes out
her phone and snaps a picture. “I
like to take pictures of my drinks.”
“They’re like family,” A.J.
says.
“They’re better than family.”
She raises her glass and clinks it to
A.J.’s.
“How is it?” he asks.
“Salty, fruity, fishy. It’s kind of
like if a shrimp cocktail decided to

make love to a Bloody Mary.”
“I like how you say make love.
The drink sounds disgusting, by the
way.”
She takes another sip and
shrugs. “It’s growing on me.”
“In what restaurant based on a
novel would you have preferred to
dine?” A.J. asks her.
“Oh, that’s tough. This won’t
make any sense, but when I was in
college I used to get really hungry
when I was reading The Gulag
Archipelago. All that description of
Soviet prison bread and soup,”
Amelia says.
“You’re weird,” A.J. says.

“Thank you. Where would you
go?” Amelia asks.
“This wouldn’t be a restaurant
per se, but I always wanted to try
the Turkish Delight in Narnia. When
I read The Lion, the Witch and the
Wardrobe as a boy, I used to think
that Turkish Delight must be
incredibly delicious if it made
Edmund betray his family,” A.J.
says. “I guess I must have told my
wife this, because one year Nic gets
a box for me for the holidays. And
it turned out to be this powdery,
gummy candy. I don’t think I’ve
ever been so disappointed in my
entire life.”

“Your
childhood
was
officially over right then.”
“I was never the same,” A.J.
says.
“Maybe the White Witch’s
was different. Like, magical
Turkish Delight tastes better.”
“Or maybe Lewis’s point is
that Edmund didn’t need much
coaxing to betray his family.”
“That’s very cynical,” Amelia
says.
“Have
you had Turkish
Delight, Amelia?”
“No,” she says.
“I’ll have to get you some,” he
says.

“What if I love it?” she asks.
“I’ll probably think less of
you.”
“Well, I won’t lie just to get
you to like me, A.J. One of my best
qualities is my honesty.”
“You told me you would have
faked a seafood allergy to get out of
eating here,” A.J. says.
“Yes, but that was only so I
wouldn’t hurt an account’s feelings.
I’d never lie about something
important like Turkish Delight.”
They order food and then
Amelia takes out the winter catalog
from her tote bag. “So, Knightley,”
she says.

“Knightley,” he repeats.
She breezes through the winter
list, ruthlessly flipping past the
books he won’t go for, emphasizing
the publisher’s great hopes, and
saving her fanciest adjectives for
her favorites. With some accounts,
you mention if the book has blurbs,
those
often
hyperbolic
endorsements from established
writers that appear on the back
cover. A.J. is not one of those
accounts. At their second or third
meeting, he had referred to blurbs
as “the blood diamonds of
publishing.” She knows him a little
better now, and needless to say, this

process is less painful for it. He
trusts me more, she thinks, or maybe
it’s just that fatherhood has
mellowed him. (It is wise to keep
thoughts like this to yourself.) A.J.
promises to read several of the
ARCs.
“In less than four years, I
hope,” Amelia says.
“I’ll do my best to have them
read in three.” He pauses. “Let’s
order dessert,” he says. “There
must be a ‘whale of a sundae’ or
something.”
Amelia groans. “That is truly
an awful wordplay.”
“So if you don’t mind my

asking, why was The Late Bloomer
your favorite book from that list?
You’re a young — ”
“I’m not that young. I’m thirtyfive.”
“That’s still young,” A.J. says.
“What I mean is you probably
haven’t experienced much of what
Mr. Friedman describes. I look at
you, and having read the book, I
wonder what made you respond to
it.”
“My, Mr. Fikry, that’s a very
personal question.” She sips at the
last of her second Queequeg. “The
main reason I loved the book was
the quality of the writing, of

course.”
“Of course. But that isn’t
enough.”
“Let’s just say I’d been on
many, many bad dates by the time
The Late Bloomer came across my
desk. I’m a romantic person, but
sometimes these don’t seem like
romantic times to me. The Late
Bloomer is a book about the
possibility of finding great love at
any age. Sounds cliché, I know.”
A.J. nods.
“And you? Why did you like
it?” Amelia asks.
“Quality of the prose, blah
blah blah.”

“I thought we weren’t allowed
to say that!” Amelia says.
“You don’t want to hear my
sad stories, do you?”
“Sure I do,” she says. “I love
sad stories.”
He gives her the Cliffs Notes
version of Nic’s death. “Friedman
gets at something specific about
what it is to lose someone. How it
isn’t one thing. He writes about
how you lose and lose and lose.”
“When did she die?” Amelia
asks.
“A while ago now. I was a
little older than you at the time.”
“That must have been a long

while ago,” she says.
He ignores the barb. “The Late
Bloomer really could have been a
popular book.”
“I know. I’m thinking of having
someone read a passage from it at
my wedding.”
A.J. pauses. “You’re getting
married, Amelia. Congratulations.
Who’s the lucky fellow?”
She stirs the harpoon around
the tomato juice-tinted waters of her
Queequeg, trying to recapture a
shrimp that’s gone AWOL. “His
name is Brett Brewer. I’d about
given up when I met him online.”
A.J. drinks the bitter dregs of

his second glass of wine. “Tell me
more.”
“He’s in the military, serving
overseas in Afghanistan.”
“Well done. You’re marrying
an American hero,” A.J. says.
“I guess I am.”
“I hate those guys,” he says.
“They make me feel totally
inadequate. Tell me something
shitty about him so that I feel
better.”
“Well, he’s not home much.”
“You must miss him a lot.”
“I do. I get a lot of reading
done, though.”
“That’s good. Does he read,

too?”
“No, actually. He’s not much
of a reader. But that’s kind of
interesting, right? I mean, it’s
interesting to be with someone
whose, um, interests are so different
from mine. I don’t know why I keep
saying ‘interests.’ The point is, he’s
a good man.”
“He’s good to you?”
She nods.
“That’s what counts. Anyway,
nobody’s perfect,” A.J. says.
“Someone probably made him read
Moby Dick in high school.”
Amelia stabs her shrimp.
“Caught it,” she says. “Your wife . .

. was she a reader?”
“And a writer. I wouldn’t
worry about it, though. Reading’s
overrated. Look at all the good stuff
on television. Stuff like True
Blood.”
“Now you’re making fun of
me.”
“Bah! Books are for nerds,”
A.J. says.
“Nerds like us.”
When the check comes, A.J.
pays despite the fact that it is
customary for the sales rep to pay in
such situations. “Are you sure?”
Amelia asks.
A.J. tells her that she can pay

next time.
Outside the restaurant, Amelia
and A.J. shake hands, and the usual
professional
pleasantries
are
exchanged. She turns to walk back
to the ferry, and one important
second later he turns to walk to the
bookstore.
“Hey A.J.,” she calls.
“There’s something kind of heroic
about being a bookseller, and
there’s also something kind of
heroic about adopting a child.”
“I do what I can.” He bows.
Halfway through the bow, he
realizes that he is not the type of
man who can pull off bowing and

quickly rights himself. “Thank you,
Amelia.”
“My friends call me Amy,” she
says.
MAYA HAS NEVER seen A.J. so
occupied. “Daddy,” she asks, “why
do you have so much homework?”
“Some of it’s extracurricular,”
he says.
“What’s ‘extracurricular’?”
“I’d look it up if I were you.”
Reading an entire season’s
list, even the list of a modestly
sized house like Knightley, is a
major time commitment for a person
with a chatty kindergartner and a
small business. After he finishes

each Knightley title, he sends
Amelia an e-mail to tell her his
thoughts. In his e-mails, he cannot
bring himself to use the nickname
“Amy,” though permission had been
granted. Sometimes, if he really
responds to something, he calls her.
If he hates a book, he’ll send a text:
Not for me. For her part, Amelia
has never received this much
attention from an account.
Don’t you have any other
publishers to read? Amelia texts
him.
A.J. thinks a long time about
his reply. None with sales reps I
like as well as you is his first draft,

but he decides this is too
presumptuous for a girl with an
American hero fiancé. He redrafts.
It’s a compelling list for
Knightley, I guess.
A.J. orders so many Knightley
titles that even Amelia’s boss
notices. “I’ve never seen a little
account like Island take so many of
our books,” the boss says. “New
owner?”
“Same guy,” Amelia says.
“But he’s different from when I first
met him.”
“Well, you must have really
done a number on him. That guy
doesn’t take what he can’t sell,” the

boss says. “Harvey never came
close to these kinds of orders with
Island.”
Finally, A.J. gets to the last
title. It’s a charming memoir about
motherhood, scrapbooking, and the
writing life, written by a Canadian
poet that A.J. has always liked. The
book is only 150 pages, but it takes
A.J. two weeks to get through it. He
can’t seem to read a chapter without
falling asleep or being distracted by
Maya. When he finishes it, he finds
himself unable to craft a response.
The writing is elegant enough, and
he thinks the women who frequent
his store could respond to it. The

problem, of course, is that once he
replies to Amelia, he’ll be done
with the Knightley winter catalog,
and he’ll have no reason to contact
Amelia until the summer list hits.
He likes her, and he thinks it’s
possible that she might like him,
despite that horrendous first
meeting. But . . . A. J. Fikry is not
the kind of man who thinks it’s okay
to try to steal another man’s fiancée.
He doesn’t believe in “the one.”
There are zillions of people in the
world; no one is that special.
Besides which, he barely knows
Amelia Loman. What if, say, he did
manage to steal her and it turned out

they weren’t compatible in bed?
Amelia texts him, What’s
happening? Didn’t you like?
Not for me, unfortunately,
A.J. replies. Looking forward to
seeing what’s on Knightley’s
summer list. Yours, A.J.
The response strikes Amelia
as overly businesslike, dismissive.
She thinks about picking up the
phone but doesn’t. She texts back,
While you’re waiting, you should
definitely watch TRUE BLOOD.
True Blood is Amelia’s favorite
television show. It had gotten to be
a kind of joke with them that A.J.
would like vampires if only he

would watch True Blood. Amelia
fancies herself a Sookie Stackhouse
type.
Not gonna happen, Amy, A.J.
writes. See you in March.
March is four and a half
months away. By then, A.J. feels
sure his little crush will have gone
away or at least resolved itself into
a more tolerable dormancy.
March is four and a half
months away.
Maya asks him what’s wrong,
and he tells her that he’s sad
because he’s not going to see his
friend for a while.
“Amelia?” Maya asks.

“How do you know about
her?”
Maya rolls her eyes, and A.J.
wonders when and where she
learned that gesture.
Lambiase hosts his Chief’s
Choice Book Club at the store that
night (selection: L.A. Confidential),
and after that, as is their tradition,
he and A.J. share a bottle.
“I think I’ve met someone,”
A.J. says after a glass has
mellowed him.
“Good news,” Lambiase says.
“The problem is, she’s
affianced to someone else.”
“Bad
timing,”
Lambiase

proclaims. “I’ve been a police
officer for twenty years now and
I’ll tell you, pretty much every bad
thing in life is a result of bad
timing, and every good thing is the
result of good timing.”
“That
seems
terribly
reductive.”
“Think about it. If Tamerlane
hadn’t gotten stolen, you wouldn’t
have left the door unlocked, and
Marian Wallace wouldn’t have left
the baby in the store. Good timing is
what that was.”
“True. But I met Amelia four
years ago,” A.J. argues. “I just
didn’t bother to notice her until a

couple of months ago.”
“Still bad timing. Your wife
had died. And then you had Maya.”
“It’s not much consolation,”
A.J. says.
“But hey, it’s good to know
your heart still works, right? Want
me to set you up with someone?”
A.J. shakes his head.
“Come on,” Lambiase insists.
“I know everyone in town.”
“Unfortunately, it’s a very
small town.”
As a warm-up, Lambiase sets
up A.J. with his cousin. The cousin
has blond hair with black roots,
overly plucked eyebrows, a heart-

shaped face, and a high-pitched
voice like Michael Jackson. She
wears a low-cut top and a push-up
bra, which creates a small, sad
shelf for her name necklace to rest.
Her name is Maria. In the middle of
mozzarella sticks, they run out of
conversation.
“What’s your favorite book?”
A.J. attempts to draw her out.
She chews on her mozzarella
stick and clutches her Maria
necklace like it’s a rosary. “This is
some kind of a test, right?”
“No, there’s no wrong
answer,” A.J. says. “I’m curious.”
She drinks her wine.

“Or you could say the book
that had the greatest influence on
your life. I’m trying to get to know
you a little.”
She takes another sip.
“Or how about the last thing
you read?”
“The last thing I read . . . ” She
furrows her brow. “The last thing I
read was this menu.”
“And the last thing I read was
your necklace,” he says. “Maria.”
The meal is perfectly cordial
after that. He never will find out
what Maria reads.
Next, Margene from the store
sets him up with her neighbor, a

lively female firefighter named
Rosie. Rosie has black hair with a
blue streak, exceptional arm
muscles, a great big laugh, and short
nails she paints red with little
orange flames. Rosie is a former
college hurdles champion, and she
likes to read sports history and
particularly athletes’ memoirs.
On their third date, she’s in the
middle of describing a dramatic
section from Jose Canseco’s Juiced
when A.J. interrupts her, “You
know they’re all ghostwritten?”
Rosie says she knows and she
doesn’t
care.
“These
highperformance individuals have been

busy training and practicing. When
did they have time to learn to write
books?”
“But these books . . . My point
is, they’re essentially lies.”
Rosie cocks her head toward
A.J. and taps her flame nails on the
table. “You’re a snob, you know
that? Makes you miss out on a lot.”
“I’ve been told that before.”
“All of life’s in a sports
memoir,” she says. “You practice
hard and you succeed, but
eventually your body gives out and
it’s over.”
“Sounds like a latter-period
Philip Roth novel,” he says.

Rosie crosses her arm. “That’s
one of those things you say to sound
smart, right?” she says. “But, really,
you’re trying to make someone else
feel stupid.”
That night in bed, after sex that
feels more like wrestling, Rosie
rolls away from him and says, “I’m
not sure I want to see you again.”
“I’m sorry if I hurt your
feelings before,” he says as he puts
his pants back on. “The memoirs
thing.”
She waves her hand. “Don’t
worry about it. You can’t help the
way you are.”
He suspects she is right. He is

a snob, not suited for relationships.
He will raise his daughter, run his
store, read his books, and that, he
decides, will be more than enough.
AT ISMAY’S INSISTENCE, it is
determined that Maya should take
dance. “You don’t want her to be
deprived, do you?” Ismay says.
“Of course not,” A.J. says.
“Well,” Ismay says, “dance is
important, not just physically but
socially, too. You don’t want her to
end up stunted.”
“I don’t know. The idea of
enrolling a little girl in dance. Isn’t
that kind of an old-fashioned and
sexist notion?”

A.J. is unsure whether Maya
will be suited to dance. Even at six,
she is cerebral — always with a
book and content at home or at the
store. “She’s not stunted,” he says.
“She reads chapter books now.”
“Not
intellectually,
obviously,” Ismay insists. “But she
seems to prefer your company to
anyone else’s, certainly anyone her
own age, and that probably isn’t
healthy.”
“Why isn’t it healthy?” Now
A.J.’s spine is tingling unpleasantly.
“She’s going to end up just
like you,” Ismay says.
“And what would be wrong

with that?”
Ismay gives him a look as if
the answer should be obvious.
“Look, A.J., you two are your own
little world. You never date — ”
“I do date.”
“You never travel — ”
A.J. interrupts. “We aren’t
talking about me.”
“Stop being so argumentative.
You asked me to be godmother, and
I’m telling you to enroll your
daughter in dance. I’ll pay for it, so
don’t you fight me anymore.”
There is one dance studio on
Alice Island and one class for girls
ages
five
and
six.
The

owner/teacher is Madame Olenska.
She is in her sixties and though she
is not overweight, her skin hangs,
suggesting that her bones have
shrunken over the years. Her
always bejeweled fingers seem to
have one joint too many. The
children are both fascinated and
frightened by her. A.J. feels the
same way. The first time he drops
off Maya, Madame Olenska says,
“Mr. Fikry, you are first man to set
foot in this dance studio in twenty
years. We must take advantage of
you.”
In her Russian accent, this
seems like a sexual invitation of

some kind, but mainly what she
requires is manual labor. For the
holiday recital, he paints and
constructs a large wooden crate to
look like a child’s block, hot-glue
guns googly eyes, bells, and
flowers, and fashions sparkly pipe
cleaners
into whiskers
and
antennae. (He suspects he will
never get the glitter out from under
his nails.)
He spends much of his free
time that winter with Madame
Olenska, and he learns a lot about
her. For
instance, Madame
Olenska’s star pupil is her daughter
who dances in a Broadway show

and whom Madame Olenska hasn’t
spoken to in a decade. She wags her
triple-jointed finger at him. “Don’t
let that happen to you.” She looks
dramatically out the window, then
slowly turns back to A.J. “You will
buy ad in program for bookstore,
yes.” It is not a question. Island
Books becomes the sole sponsor of
The Nutcracker, Rudolph and
Friends, and a holiday coupon for
the store appears on the back page
of the program. A.J. goes even
further, providing a gift basket of
dance-themed books to be raffled
off with proceeds going to the
Boston Ballet.

From the raffle table, A.J.
watches the show, exhausted and
slightly fluish. As the acts are
arranged according to skill, Maya’s
group is on first. She is an
enthusiastic if not overly graceful
mouse. She scurries with abandon.
She wrinkles her nose in a
recognizably mousy way. She wags
her pipe-cleaner tail, which had
been painstakingly coiled by him.
He knows a career in dance is not
in her future.
Ismay, who mans the table
with him, hands him a Kleenex.
“Cold,” he says.
“Sure it is,” Ismay says.

At the end of the night,
Madame Olenska says, “Thank you,
Mr. Fikry. You are good man.”
“Maybe I’ve got a good kid.”
He still needs to claim his mouse
from the dressing room.
“Yes,” she says. “But this is
not enough. You must find yourself
good woman.”
“I like my life,” A.J. says.
“You think child is enough, but
child grows old. You think work is
enough, but work is not warm
body.” He suspects Madame
Olenska has already tossed back a
few Stolis.
“Happy holidays, Madame

Olenska.”
Walking home with Maya, he
is contemplating the teacher’s
words. He has been alone for
nearly six years. Grief is hard to
bear, but being alone he has never
much minded. Besides, he doesn’t
want any old warm body. He wants
Amelia Loman with her big heart
and bad clothes. Someone like her,
at least.
Snow is beginning to fall, and
the flakes catch in Maya’s
whiskers. He wants to take a
picture, but he doesn’t want to do
the thing where you stop to take a
picture. “Whiskers become you,”

A.J. tells her.
The compliment to her
whiskers sets off a stream of
observations about the recital, but
A.J. is distracted. “Maya,” he says,
“do you know how old I am?”
“Yes,” she says. “Twentytwo.”
“I’m quite a bit older than
that.”
“Eighty-nine?”
“I’m . . .” He holds up both his
palms four times, and then three
fingers.
“Forty-three?”
“Good job. I’m forty-three,
and in these years I’ve learned that

it’s better to have loved and lost
and blah blah blah and that it’s
better to be alone than be with
someone you don’t really fancy. Do
you agree?”
She nods solemnly, and her
mouse ears almost fall off.
“Sometimes, though, I get tired
of learning lessons.” He looks
down at his daughter’s puzzled
face. “Are your feet getting wet?”
She nods, and he squats on the
ground so that she can get on his
back. “Put your arms around my
neck.” Once she is mounted, he
stands, groaning a little. “You’re
bigger than you used to be.”

She grabs his earlobe. “What’s
that?” she asks.
“I used to have an earring,” he
says.
“Why?” she asks. “Were you a
pirate?”
“I was young,” he says.
“My age?”
“Older than that. There was a
girl.”
“A wench?”
“A woman. She liked this band
called The Cure, and she thought it
would be cool if she pierced my
ear.”
Maya thinks about this. “Did
you have a parrot?”

“I didn’t. I had a girlfriend.”
“Could the parrot talk?”
“No, because there wasn’t a
parrot.”
She tries to trick him. “What
was the parrot’s name?”
“There wasn’t a parrot.”
“But if there was one, what
would his name have been?”
“How do you know it’s a he?”
he asks.
“Oh!” She puts her hand to her
mouth, and she begins to tip
backward.
“Hold on to my neck or you’ll
fall off. Maybe she was called
Amy?”

“Amy the parrot. I knew it.
Did you have a ship?” Maya asks.
“Yes. It had books on it, and it
really was more of a research
vessel. We studied a lot.”
“You’re ruining this story.”
“It’s a fact, Maya. There are
murdering kinds of pirates and
researching kinds of pirates, and
your daddy was the latter.”
THE ISLAND IS never a popular
destination during the wintertime,
but that year Alice is exceptionally
inclement. The roads are an ice
rink, and ferry service is canceled
for days at a time. Even Daniel
Parish is forced to stay at home. He

writes a little, avoids his wife, and
spends the rest of his time with A.J.
and Maya.
As do most women, Maya
likes Daniel. When he comes to the
store, he does not talk to her like
she is a simpleton just because she
is a child. Even at six, she is
sensitive to people who are
condescending. Daniel always asks
her what she is reading and what
she thinks. Furthermore, he has
bushy blond eyebrows and a voice
that makes her think of damask.
One afternoon a week or so
after New Year’s, Daniel and Maya
are reading on the floor of the

bookstore when she turns to him
and says, “Uncle Daniel, I have a
question. Don’t you ever go to
work?”
“I’m working right now,
Maya,” Daniel says.
She takes off her glasses and
wipes them on her shirt. “You don’t
look like you’re working. You look
like you’re reading. Don’t you have
a place you go where you have a
job?” She elaborates, “Lambiase is
a police officer. Daddy is a
bookseller. What do you do?”
Daniel picks Maya up and
carries her to the local author
section of Island Books. Out of

courtesy to his brother-in-law, A.J.
stocks Daniel’s entire body of
works, though the only book that
ever sells is that first one, The
Children in the Apple Tree . Daniel
points to his name on the spine.
“That’s me,” he says. “That’s my
job.”
Maya’s eyes grow wide.
“Daniel Parish. You write books,”
she says. “You’re a” — she says the
word with reverence — “writer.
What is this about?”
“It’s about the follies of man.
It’s a love story and a tragedy.”
“That is very general,” Maya
tells him.

“It’s about this nurse who has
spent her life taking care of other
people. She gets in a car accident,
and people have to take care of her
for the first time in her life.”
“That does not sound like
something I would read,” Maya
says.
“Bit corny, eh?”
“Nooooo.” She doesn’t want
to hurt Daniel’s feelings. “But I like
books with more action.”
“More action, huh? Me too.
The good news is, Miss Fikry, all
the time I spend reading, I’m
learning how to do it better,”
Daniel explains.

Maya thinks about this. “I want
this job.”
“Many people do, my girl.”
“How do I get it?” Maya asks.
“Reading, as aforementioned.”
Maya nods. “I do that.”
“A good chair.”
“I have one of those.”
“Then you’re well on your
way,” Daniel tells her before
setting her back on the ground. “I’ll
teach you the rest later. You’re very
good company, do you know that?”
“That’s what Daddy says.”
“Smart man. Lucky man. Good
man. Smart kid, too.”
A.J. calls Maya upstairs to

dinner. “Do you want to join?” A.J.
asks him.
“Bit early for me,” Daniel
says. “Plus I’ve got work to do.”
He winks at Maya.
AT LAST IT is March. The roads
thaw, turning everything to muck.
Ferry service resumes, as do Daniel
Parish’s wanderings. Sales reps
come to town with their summer
offerings, and A.J. goes out of his
way to be hospitable to them. He
takes to wearing a tie as a way of
signaling to Maya that he is “at
work” as opposed to “at home.”
Perhaps because it is the
meeting he is most anticipating, he

schedules Amelia’s sales call for
last. About two weeks before their
date, he sends her a text: Pequod’s
OK with you? Or would you rather
try something new?
Queequegs on me this time,
she replies. Did u watch TRUE
BLOOD yet?
The
winter
had
been
particularly
inhospitable
to
socializing, so at night, after Maya
had gone to sleep, A.J. had plowed
through four seasons of True Blood.
The project hadn’t taken him long
since he’d liked it more than he
expected  — a cross between
Flannery O’Connor southern gothic

and The Fall of the House of Usher
or Caligula. He’d been planning to
casually dazzle Amelia with his
True Blood knowledge when she
came to town.
You’ll have to find out when
you get here, he writes, but does
not press Send because he decides
this text sounds too provocative. He
hadn’t known when Amelia’s
wedding was supposed to be, so
she could already be a married
woman
now. See you next
Thursday, he writes.
On Wednesday, he gets a call
from a number he doesn’t
recognize. The caller turns out to be

Brett Brewer, American Hero, who
sounds like Bill from True Blood.
A.J. thinks the accent sounds fake,
but obviously an American hero
would have no need to fake a
southern accent. “Mr Fikry, Brett
Brewer callin’ for Amelia. She’s
had an accident, so she asked me to
tell you she’ll have to change
y’all’s meetin’ time.”
A.J. loosens his tie. “I hope
nothing serious.”
“I’m always tryin’ to get her to
stop wearin’ those galoshes of hers.
They’re fine for rain, but kinda
dangerous in the ice, y’know? Well,
she slipped on some icy steps here

in Providence, which is what I told
her would happen, and she broke
her ankle. She’s havin’ surgery right
now. So nothin’ serious, but she’ll
be laid up for a spell.”
“Give your fiancée my
regards, would you?” A.J. says.
A pause. A.J. wonders if the
phone has cut out. “Will do,” Brett
Brewer says before hanging up the
phone.
A.J. is relieved that Amelia
isn’t too hurt but a bit disappointed
that she isn’t coming (and also by
the news that the American hero is
most definitely still in the picture).
He thinks about sending

Amelia flowers or a book but
ultimately decides to send her a
text. He tries to find a True Blood
quote, something that will make her
laugh. When he Googles the matter,
the quotes all seem too provocative.
He writes, I’m sorry you’re hurt.
Had been looking forward to
hearing Knightley’s summer list.
Hope we can reschedule soon.
Also, and it pains me to say this
 — “Giving
Jason
Stackhouse
vampire blood is like giving Ho
Hos to a diabetic.”
Six hours later, Amelia writes
back, YOU WATCHED!!!
A.J.: I did.

Amelia: Could we do the list
over the phone or Skype?
A.J.: What’s Skype?
Amelia: Do I have to teach
you everything?!?
After Amelia explains what
Skype is, they decide to meet that
way.
A.J. is happy to see her even if
it has to be on a video screen.
While she’s going through the list,
he finds he can barely pay attention.
He is fascinated by the Amelianess
of the things in the frame behind
her: a mason jar filled with dying
sunflowers, a diploma from Vassar
(he thinks it says), a bobblehead of

Hermione Granger, a framed
picture of a young Amelia and
people he guesses are her parents, a
lamp with a polka-dotted scarf
draped over it, a stapler that looks
like a Keith Haring figure, an old
edition of some book whose title
A.J. cannot make out, a bottle of
sparkly nail polish, a windup
lobster, a set of plastic vampire
fangs, an unopened bottle of good
champagne, a — 
“A.J.,” Amelia interrupts.
“Are you listening?”
“Yes, of course. I’m . . .”
Staring at your things? “I’m
unused to Skyping. Can I make

Skype a verb?”
“I don’t think OED has
weighed in on the matter, but I think
you’ll be fine,” she says. “As I was
saying, that Knightley has not one,
but two, short-story collections on
the summer list.”
Amelia goes on to describe the
collections, and A.J. returns to
spying. What is that book? It’s
skinnier than a bible or a
dictionary. He leans in to try to see
it better, but the worn gold leaf text
is too faded to decipher out over a
video conference call. How
irritating that he can’t zoom in or
change the angle. She is no longer

speaking. Clearly, some response is
required from A.J.
“Yes, I’m looking forward to
reading them,” he says.
“Great. I’ll put them in the
mail to you today or tomorrow. So
that’s it until the fall list.”
“I hope you’ll be able to come
in person.”
“I will. I definitely will.”
“What’s the book?” A.J. asks.
“What book?”
“The old one leaning against
the lamp, on the table behind you.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know?”
she says. “It’s my favorite. A gift
from my father for my college

graduation.”
“So what is it?”
“If you ever make it down to
Providence, I’ll show you,” she
says.
A.J. looks at her. This might
have sounded flirtatious except she
hadn’t even looked up from the
notes she’d been writing when she
said it. And yet . . .
“Brett Brewer seemed like a
nice guy,” A.J. says.
“What?”
“When he called me to say you
were hurt and couldn’t come,” A.J.
explains.
“Right.”

“I thought he sounded like Bill
from True Blood.”
Amelia laughs. “Look at you,
casually dropping the True Blood
references. I’ll have to tell Brett
that the next time I see him.”
“When’s the wedding, by the
way? Or has it already happened?”
She looks up at him. “It’s off,
actually.”
“I’m sorry,” A.J. says.
“It happened a while ago.
Over Christmas.”
“I thought because he called . .
.”
“He was crashing at my house
at the time. I try to stay friends with

my exes,” Amelia says. “I’m that
way.”
A.J. knows he is being
intrusive, but he can’t stop himself.
“What happened?”
“Brett’s a great guy, but the
sad truth is we didn’t have very
much in common.”
“Shared
sensibility does
matter,” A.J. says.
Amelia’s phone rings. “My
mother. I have to take this,” she
says. “I’ll see you in a couple of
months, okay?”
A.J. nods. Skype clicks off,
and Amelia’s status changes to
Away.

He opens his browser and
Googles the following phrase:
“educational family attractions near
Providence, Rhode Island.” The
search yields no distinctive results:
a children’s museum, a doll
museum, a lighthouse, and other
things he could more easily do in
Boston. He settles on the Green
Animals Topiary Garden in
Portsmouth. He and Maya had read
a picture book with topiary animals
in it a while ago, and she’d seemed
mostly interested in the subject.
Plus it’s good for them to get off the
island, right? He’ll take Maya to
see the animals, then swing by

Providence to see a sick friend.
“Maya,” he says that night at
dinner, “how would you like to see
a giant topiary elephant?”
She gives him a look. “Your
voice is funny.”
“It’s cool, Maya. You
remember that book we read with
the topiaries?”
“You mean, when I was little.”
“Right. I found this place with
a topiary animal garden. I have to
go to Providence anyway to see a
sick friend so I thought it would be
cool for us to see the animal garden
while we were there.” He gets out
his computer and shows her the

website with the topiary animals.
“Okay,” she says seriously. “I
would like to see that.” She points
out that the website says that the
topiary garden is in Portsmouth, not
Providence.
“Portsmouth and Providence
are really close,” A.J. says. “Rhode
Island is the country’s smallest
state.”
It turns out, however, that
Portsmouth and Providence are not
all that close. Although there is a
bus, the easiest way to get to there
is by car, and A.J. doesn’t have a
driver’s license. He calls Lambiase
and asks him to come with them.

“Kid’s super into topiaries,
huh?” Lambiase asks.
“She’s mad for them,” A.J.
says.
“Seems a weird thing for a kid
to be into, that’s all I’m saying.”
“She’s a weird kid.”
“But is the middle of winter
the best time for touring a garden?”
“It’s almost spring. Besides,
Maya’s into topiaries right now.
Who knows if she’ll be as
interested come summer?”
“Kids change quick. It’s true,”
Lambiase says.
“Look, you don’t have to
come.”

“Oh, I’ll come. Who wouldn’t
want to see a giant green elephant?
The thing is, though, sometimes
people tell you you’re on one kind
of trip, but it turns out to be another
kind of trip, you know what I mean?
I just want to know what kind of
trip I’m on. Are we going to see
topiaries, or are we going to see
something else? Maybe that lady
friend of yours, say?”
A.J. inhales. “It crossed my
mind that I might stop by to see
Amelia, yes.”
A.J. texts Amelia the next day:
Forgot to mention that Maya and I
are going to be in Rhode Island

next weekend. Instead of you
mailing the galleys, I could pick
them up.
Ame l i a : Don’t have them
here. Having them sent from NYC.
So much for that ill-conceived
plan, A.J. thinks.
A couple of minutes later,
Amelia sends another text: What
are you doing in Rhode Island
anyway?
A. J . : Going to the topiary
garden in Portsmouth. Maya loves
topiaries! (He is only slightly
mortified by that exclamation
point.)
Amelia: Didn’t know there

was one. Wish I could come with
you, but I’m still only semimobile.
A.J. waits a couple of minutes
before he texts: Are you in need of
visitors? Maybe we could stop by.
She does not immediately
respond. A.J. takes her silence to
mean that she has all the visitors
she needs.
The next day, Amelia does text
back: Sure. I’d like that. Don’t eat.
I’ll make something for you and
Maya.
“YOU CAN KIND of see them if
you get on your tippy toes and look
over the fence,” A.J. says. “There,
in the distance!” They had left Alice

at seven that morning, taken the
ferry to Hyannis, then driven two
hours to Portsmouth only to
discover that the Green Animals
Topiary Garden is closed from
November through May.
A.J. finds that he cannot make
eye contact with either his daughter
or Lambiase. It is twenty-nine
degrees, but shame is keeping him
warm.
Maya stands on her toes and
when that doesn’t work, she tries
hopping. “I can’t see anything,” she
says.
“Here, I’ll get you higher,”
Lambiase says, lifting Maya onto

his shoulders.
“Maybe I can see a little bit,”
Maya says doubtfully. “No, I
definitely cannot see anything.
They’re all covered.” Her lower lip
begins to quiver. She looks at A.J.
with pained eyes. He doesn’t think
he can take any more of this.
Suddenly, she smiles brightly
at A.J. “But you know what,
Daddy? I can imagine what the
elephant looks like under the
blanket. And the tiger! And the
unicorn!” She nods at her father as
if to say, Clearly this imaginative
exercise must have been your point
in taking me here in the middle of

winter.
“That’s very good, Maya.” He
feels like the worst parent in the
world, but Maya’s faith in him
seems to be restored.
“Look, Lambiase! The unicorn
is shivering. She’s glad to be
wearing the blanket. Can you see it,
Lambiase?”
A.J. walks over to the security
kiosk, where the guard shoots him a
sympathetic expression. “Happens
all the time,” she says.
“Then you don’t think I’ve
scarred my daughter for life?” A.J.
asks.
“Sure,” says the guard.

“You’ve probably done that, but I
doubt from anything that happened
today. No child ever turned bad
from not seeing topiary animals.”
“Even if her father’s real
purpose was a sexy girl in
Providence?”
The guard doesn’t seem to
hear that part. “My suggestion to
you is that you tour the Victorian
residence instead. Kids love those.”
“Do they?”
“Some of them. Sure. Why
not? Maybe you’ve got the kind that
does.”
AT THE MANSION, Maya is
reminded of From the Mixed-Up

Files of Ms. Basil E. Frankweiler,
a book Lambiase hasn’t read.
“Oh, you must, Lambiase,”
Maya says. “You will love it.
There’s this girl and her brother,
and they run away — ”
“Running away’s no laughing
matter.” Lambiase frowns. “As a
police officer, I can tell you that
kids don’t do well on the streets.”
Maya continues, “They go to
this big museum in New York City,
and they hide out there. It’s — ”
“It’s criminal is what it is,”
Lambiase says. “It’s definitely
trespassing. It’s probably breaking
and entering, too.”

“Lambiase,” Maya says, “you
are missing the point.”
After an overpriced lunch at a
mansion, they drive to Providence
to check into their hotel.
“You go visit Amelia,”
Lambiase tells A.J. “I was thinking
me and the kid would go to the
Children’s Museum in town. I’d
like to show her the many reasons it
would be impractical to hide out in
a museum. In a post – September
eleventh universe at least.”
“You don’t have to do that.”
A.J. had planned to take Maya with
him so that the visit to Amelia’s
would seem more casual. (Yes, he

was not above using his beloved
daughter as a prop.)
“Stop
looking
guilty,”
Lambiase says. “That’s what
godfathers are for. Backup.”
A.J. gets to Amelia’s house
just before five. He has brought her
an Island Books tote filled with
Charlaine Harris novels, a good
bottle of Malbec, and a bouquet of
sunflowers. After he rings the
doorbell, he decides the flowers
are too obvious and he stows them
under the cushions of the porch
swing.
When she answers the door,
her knee is supported by a wheelie

cart. Her cast is pink and has been
signed as much as the most popular
kid in school’s yearbook. She is
wearing a navy blue minidress with
a red patterned scarf tied jauntily
around her neck. She looks like an
airline stewardess.
“Where’s Maya?” Amelia
asks.
“My friend Lambiase took her
to the Providence Children’s
Museum.”
Amelia cocks her head. “This
isn’t a date, is it?”
A.J. tries to explain about the
topiary garden having been closed.
The story sounds incredibly

unconvincing — halfway
through
telling it, he almost decides to drop
the tote and run.
“I’m teasing,” she says. “Come
in.”
Amelia’s house is cluttered but
clean. She has a purple velvet
couch, a smallish grand piano, a
dining-room table that seats twelve,
many framed pictures of her friends
and family, several houseplants in
various states of health, a one-eyed
tabby cat named Puddleglum, and of
course, books everywhere. Her
house smells like what she’s
cooking, which turns out to be
lasagna and garlic bread. He takes

off his boots so as not to track mud
into her house. “Your place is just
like you,” he says.
“Cluttered, mismatched,” she
says.
“Eclectic, charming.” He
clears his throat and tries not to feel
unbearably corny.
They are through with dinner
and into their second bottle of wine
when A.J. finally gets up the nerve
to ask her what had happened with
Brett Brewer.
Amelia smiles a little. “If I tell
you the truth, I don’t want you to get
the wrong idea.”
“I won’t. I promise.”

She finishes the dregs of her
wine. “Last fall, when we were
corresponding all the time . . .
Listen, I don’t want you to think I
broke up with him for you because I
didn’t. I broke up with him because
talking to you made me remember
how important it is to share a
sensibility with someone, to share
passions. I probably sound silly.”
“No,” A.J. says.
She narrows her pretty brown
eyes. “You were so mean to me the
first time we met. I still haven’t
forgiven you, you know.”
“I’d hoped you’d forgotten
that.”

“I haven’t. My memory is very
long, A.J.”
“I was awful,” A.J. says. “In
my defense, I was going through a
bad time.” He leans across the table
and brushes a blond curl off of her
face. “The first time I saw you, I
thought you looked like a
dandelion.”
She pats her hair selfconsciously. “My hair’s such a
pain.”
“It’s my favorite flower.”
“I think it’s actually a weed,”
she says.
“You’re rather stunning, you
know.”

“They used to call me Big
Bird in school.”
“I’m sorry.”
“There are worse names,” she
says. “I told my mother about you.
She said that you didn’t sound like
good boyfriend material, A.J.”
“I know. I’m sorry for that.
Because I like you enormously.”
Amelia sighs and moves to
clear the table.
A.J. rises. “No, please. Let
me. You should sit.” He stacks the
dishes and moves them into the
dishwasher.
“Do you want to see what that
book is?” she says.

“What book?” A.J. asks as he
fills the lasagna dish with water.
“The one in my office that you
asked about. Isn’t that what you
came to see?” She rises to her feet,
swapping out her rolling device for
crutches. “My office is through my
bedroom, by the way.”
A.J. nods. He walks briskly
through the bedroom so as not to
seem presumptuous. He is almost to
the office door when Amelia sits on
her bed and says, “Wait. I’ll show
you the book tomorrow.” She pats
the place on the bed next to her.
“My ankle hurts, so apologies if my
seduction lacks some of the subtlety

it might usually have.”
He tries to be cool as he walks
back across the room to Amelia’s
bed, but A.J. has never been cool.
AFTER AMELIA HAS
fallen
asleep, A.J. tiptoes into the office.
The book leans against the
lamp, unmoved since the day they
talked over the computer. Even in
person, the cover is too faded to be
made out. He opens to the title
page: A Good Man Is Hard to Find
and Other Stories by Flannery
O’Connor.
“Dear Amy,” the book is
inscribed, “Mom says this is your
favorite writer. I hope you won’t

mind that I read the title story. I
found it a bit dark, but I did enjoy it.
A very happy graduation day! I am
so proud of you. Love always,
Dad.”
A.J. closes the book and sets it
back against the lamp.
He writes a note: “Dear
Amelia, I honestly don’t think I
could bear it if you waited until the
Knightley fall list to come back to
Alice Island.  — A.J.F.”

Chapter 6. The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County
1865 / Mark Twain
Proto-postmodernist story of a
habitual gambler and his bested frog.
The plot isn’t much, but it’s worth
reading because of the fun Twain has
with narrative authority. (In reading
Twain, I often suspect he is having
more fun than I am.)
“Jumping Frog” always reminds me
of the time Leon Friedman came to
town. Do you remember, Maya? If not,
ask Amy to tell you about it someday.
Through the doorway, I can see
you both sitting on Amy’s old purple
couch. You are reading Song of
Solomon by Toni Morrison, and she is
reading Olive Kitteridge by Elizabeth

Strout. The tabby, Puddleglum, is
between you, and I am happier than I
can ever remember being.
 — A.J.F.

That spring, Amelia takes to
wearing flats and finds herself
making more sales calls to Island
Books than the account, strictly
speaking, requires. If her boss
notices, he does not say. Publishing
is still a gentleperson’s business,
and besides, A. J. Fikry is carrying
an extraordinary number of
Knightley titles, more than nearly
any other bookstore in the Northeast
corridor. The boss does not care
whether the numbers are driven by
love or commerce or both.
“Perhaps,” the boss says to Amelia,
“you might suggest to Mr. Fikry a
spotlight on Knightley Press table in

the front of the store?”
That spring, A.J. kisses
Amelia just before she gets on the
ferry back to Hyannis and says,
“You can’t be based from an island.
You have to travel too much for
your job.”
She holds him at arm’s length
and laughs at him. “I agree, but is
that your way of asking me to move
to Alice?”
“No, I’m . . . Well, I’m
thinking of you,” A.J. says. “It
wouldn’t be practical for you to
move to Alice. That’s my point.”
“No, it wouldn’t be,” she says.
She stencils a heart on his chest

with a fluorescent pink nail.
“What hue is that?” A.J. asks.
“Rose-Colored Glasses.” The
horn sounds, and Amelia boards the
boat.
That spring, while waiting for
a Greyhound bus, A.J. says to
Amelia, “You couldn’t even get to
Alice three months of the year.”
“It would have been easier for
me to commute to Afghanistan,” she
says. “I like how you bring this up
at the bus station, by the way.”
“I try to put it out of my mind
until the last minute.”
“That’s one strategy.”
“I take it you mean not a good

one.” He grabs her hand. Her hands
are large but shapely. A piano
player’s hands. A sculptress. “You
have the hands of an artist.”
Amelia rolls her eyes. “And
the mind of a book sales rep.”
Her nails are painted a deep
shade of purple. “What color this
time?” he asks.
“Blues Traveler. While I’m
thinking about it, would you mind if
I painted Maya’s nails the next time
I’m on Alice? She keeps asking
me.”
That spring, Amelia takes
Maya to the drugstore and lets her
choose any polish color she likes.

“How do you pick?” Maya says.
“Sometimes I ask myself how
I’m feeling,”
Amelia
says.
“Sometimes I ask myself how I’d
like to be feeling.”
Maya studies the rows of glass
bottles. She selects a red then puts
it back. She takes iridescent silver
off the shelf.
“Ooh, pretty. Here’s the best
part. Each color has a name,”
Amelia tells her. “Turn the bottle
over.”
Maya does. “It’s a title like a
book! Pearly Riser,” she reads.
“What’s yours called?”
Amy has selected a pale blue.

“Keeping Things Light.”
That
weekend,
Maya
accompanies A.J. to the dock. She
throws her arms around Amelia and
tells her not to go. “I don’t want to,”
Amelia says.
“Then why do you have to?”
Maya asks.
“Because I don’t live here.”
“Why don’t you live here?”
“Because
my
job
is
somewhere else.”
“You could come work at the
store.”
“I couldn’t. Your dad would
probably kill me. Besides, I like my
job.” She looks at A.J., who is

making a great show of checking his
phone. The horn sounds.
“Say good-bye to Amy,” A.J.
says.
Amelia calls A.J. from the
ferry, “I can’t move from
Providence. You can’t move from
Alice. The situation is pretty much
irresolvable.”
“It is,” he agrees. “What color
were you wearing today?”
“Keeping Things Light.”
“Is that significant?”
“No,” she says.
That spring, Amelia’s mother
says, “It isn’t fair to you. You’re
thirty-six years old, and you aren’t

getting any younger. If you truly
want to have a baby, you can’t
waste any more time in impossible
relationships, Amy.”
And Ismay says to A.J., “It
isn’t fair to Maya to have this
Amelia person be such a big part of
your life if you aren’t really serious
about her.”
And Daniel says to A.J., “You
shouldn’t change your life for any
woman.”
That June, the good weather
makes A.J. and Amelia forget these
and other objections. When Amelia
comes to pitch the fall list, she stays
for two weeks. She wears

seersucker shorts and flip-flops
adorned with daisies. “I probably
won’t see you much this summer,”
she says. “I’ll be traveling for work
and then my mother’s coming to
Providence in August.”
“I could come see you,” A.J.
suggests.
“I really won’t be around,”
Amelia says. “Except for August,
and my mother is an acquired
taste.”
A.J. puts sunscreen on her
strong, soft back and decides he
simply can’t be without her. He
decides to contrive a reason for her
to come to Alice.

The minute she’s back to
Providence, A.J. calls her on
Skype. “I’ve been thinking. We
should have Leon Friedman come
sign at the store in August while the
summer people are still in town.”
“You hate the summer
people,” Amelia says. She has
heard A.J. rant on more than one
occasion about the seasonal
residents of Alice Island: the
families who come into his store
right after buying ice cream from
Captain Boomer’s and let their
toddlers run around touching
everything, the theater festival
people with their too-loud laughs,

the reverse snowbirds who think
going to the beach once a week
suffices for personal hygiene.
“That isn’t true,” A.J. says. “I
like to complain, but I sell them a
fair number of books, too. Plus Nic
used to say that, contrary to popular
belief, the best time to have an
author event was during August.
The people are so bored by then,
they’ll do anything for distraction,
even go to an author reading.”
“An author reading,” Amelia
says. “My, that is substandard
entertainment.”
“Compared to True Blood, I
suppose.”

She ignores him. “Actually, I
love readings.” When she was
starting out in publishing, a
boyfriend had dragged her to a
ticketed Alice McDermott event at
the 92nd Street Y. Amelia thought
she hadn’t liked Charming Billy,
but she realized when she heard
McDermott read from it — the way
her arms moved, the emphasis she
placed on certain words — that she
hadn’t understood the novel at all.
When they left the reading, the
boyfriend had apologized to her on
the subway, “Sorry if that was kind
of a bust.” A week later, she ended
the relationship. She can’t help

thinking how young she’d been,
how impossibly high her standards.
“Okay,” Amelia says to A.J.
“I’ll put you in touch with the
publicist.”
“You’ll come, too, right?”
“I’ll try. My mother’s visiting
me in August so — ”
“Bring her!” A.J. says. “I’d
like to meet your mother.”
“You only say that because
you haven’t met her yet,” Amelia
says.
“Amelia, my love, you have to
attend. I’m having Leon Friedman
for you.”
“I don’t remember saying I

wanted to meet Leon Friedman,”
Amelia says. But that’s the beauty
of video calling, A.J. thinks —  he
can see that she’s smiling.
FIRST THING MONDAY morning,
A.J. calls Leon Friedman’s
publicist at Knightley. She’s
twenty-six and brand new like they
always are. She has to Google Leon
Friedman to figure out what the
book is. “Oh, wow, you’re the first
appearance request I’ve had for The
Late Bloomer.”
“The book is really a store
favorite. We’ve sold quite a few
copies of it,” A.J. says.
“You might be the first person

t o ever host an event with Leon
Friedman. Like seriously, ever. I’m
not sure.” The publicist pauses.
“Let me talk to his editor to see if
he’s up to doing events. I’ve never
met him, but I’m looking at his
picture right now, and he’s . . .
mature. Can I give you a call
back?”
“Assuming he’s not too mature
to travel, I’d want to schedule it for
the end of August before the
summer people leave. He’ll sell
more books that way.”
A week later, the publicist
leaves word that Leon Friedman is
not yet dead and available in

August to come to Island Books.
A.J. has not hosted an author
for years. The reason being, he has
no talent for such arrangements. The
last time Island had an author event
was back when Nic was still alive,
and she had always organized
everything. He tries to remember
what she had done.
He orders books, hangs
posters in the store with Leon
Friedman’s ancient face, sends
relevant social media dispatches,
and asks his friends and employees
to do the same. Still, his efforts feel
incomplete. Nic’s book parties
always had a gimmick, so A.J. tries

to come up with one. Leon
Friedman is OLD, and the book
flopped. Neither fact seems like
much to hang a party on. The book
is
romantic
but
incredibly
depressing. A.J. decides to call
Lambiase. He suggests frozen
shrimp from Costco, which A.J.
now recognizes as Lambiase’s
default party-throwing suggestion.
“Hey,” Lambiase says, “if you’re
doing events now, I’d really love to
meet Jeffery Deaver. We’re all big
fans of his at the Alice PD.”
A.J. then calls Daniel, who
informs him, “The only thing a good
book party needs is plenty of

liquor.”
“Put Ismay on the phone,” A.J.
says.
“This isn’t terribly literary or
brilliant, but how about a garden
party?” Ismay says. “The Late
Bloomer. Blooms, get it?”
“I do,” he says.
“Everyone wears flowered
hats. You have the writer judge a
hat contest or something. It will
lighten the mood, and all the
mothers you’re friends with will
probably show up, if only for the
chance to take pictures of each
other wearing ridiculous hats.”
A.J. considers this. “That

sounds horrible.”
“It was only a suggestion.”
“But as I think about it, it’s
probably the right kind of horrible.”
“I accept the compliment. Is
Amelia coming?”
“I certainly hope so,” A.J.
says. “I’m having this damned party
for her.”
THAT JULY, A.J. and Maya go to
the only fine jewelry store on Alice
Island. A.J. points out a vintage ring
with a simple setting and square
stone.
“Too plain,” Maya says. She
selects a yellow diamond as big as
the Ritz, which turns out to be

roughly the cost of a first-edition
mint-condition Tamerlane.
They settle on a 1960s era ring
with a diamond in the middle and a
setting made out of enamel petals.
“Like a daisy,” Maya says. “Amy
likes flowers and happy things.”
A.J. thinks the ring is a bit
gaudy, but he knows Maya is right
 — this is the one Amelia would
pick, the one that will make her
happy. At the very least, the ring
will match her flip-flops.
On the walk back to the
bookstore, A.J. warns Maya that
Amelia could say no. “She’d still
be our friend,” A.J. says, “even if

she did say no.”
Maya nods, then nods some
more. “Why would she say no?”
“Well . . . Lots of reasons,
actually. Your dad is not exactly a
catch.”
Maya laughs. “You’re silly.”
“And the place we live is hard
to get to, and Amy has to travel for
her work.”
“Are you going to ask her at
the book party?” Maya asks.
A.J. shakes his head. “No, I
don’t want to embarrass her.”
“Why would it embarrass
her?”
“Well, I don’t want her to feel

cornered into saying yes because
there’s a crowd, you know?” When
he had been nine years old, his
father had taken him to a Giants
game. They had ended up sitting
next to a woman who was proposed
to at half-time over the Jumbotron.
Yes, the woman had said when the
camera had been on her. But as
soon as the third quarter started, the
woman had begun to cry
uncontrollably. A.J. had never much
liked football after that. “And
maybe I don’t want to embarrass
myself either.”
“After the party?” Maya says.
“Yes, maybe if I work up the

courage.” He looks at Maya. “Is
this okay with you, by the way?”
She nods and then she wipes
her glasses on her T-shirt. “Daddy,
I told her about the topiaries.”
“What about them exactly?”
“I told her that I don’t even
like them and that I was pretty sure
we had gone to Rhode Island to see
her that time.”
“Why did you tell her that?”
“She said a couple of months
ago that you were ‘a hard person to
read sometimes.’ ”
“I’m afraid that is probably
true.”
AUTHORS NEVER LOOK that

much like their author photos, but
the first thing A.J. thinks when he
meets Leon Friedman is that he
really doesn’t look like his author
photo. Photo Leon Friedman is
thinner, clean-shaven, and his nose
looks longer. Actual Leon Friedman
looks somewhere between old
Ernest
Hemingway
and
a
department store Santa Claus: big
red nose and belly, bushy white
beard, twinkly eyes. Actual Leon
Friedman looks about ten years
younger than his author photo. A.J.
decides maybe it’s just the excess
weight and the beard. “Leon
Friedman. Novelist extraordinaire,”

Friedman introduces himself. He
pulls A.J. into a bear hug. “Pleased
to meet you. You must be A.J. The
gal at Knightley says you love my
book. Good taste on your part, if I
do say so myself.”
“It’s interesting that you call
the book a novel,” A.J. says.
“Would you say it’s a novel or a
memoir?”
“Ah, well, we’ll be debating
that until the cows come home,
won’t we? You wouldn’t happen to
have a drink for me. A bit of the old
vino always makes these kinds of
events go better for me.”
Ismay has provided tea and

finger sandwiches for the event but
not alcohol. The event had been
scheduled for 2 p.m. on a Sunday,
and Ismay hadn’t thought liquor
would be necessary or suit the
mood of the party. A.J. goes
upstairs for a bottle of wine.
When he gets back downstairs,
Maya is sitting on Leon Friedman’s
knee.
“I like The Late Bloomer,”
Maya is saying, “but I’m not sure
I’m the intended audience.”
“Oh ho ho, that is a very
interesting observation, little girl,”
Leon Friedman replies.
“I make many of them. The

only other writer I know is Daniel
Parish. Do you know him?”
“Not sure that I do.”
Maya sighs. “You are harder
to talk to than Daniel Parish. What
is your favorite book?”
“Don’t know that I have one.
Why don’t you tell me what you’d
like for Christmas instead?”
“Christmas?” Maya says.
“Christmas isn’t for four months.”
A.J. claims his daughter from
Friedman’s lap and gives him a
glass of wine in exchange. “Thank
you kindly,” Friedman says.
“Would you mind terribly
signing some stock for the store

before the reading?” A.J. leads
Friedman to the back where he sets
him up with a carton of paperback
books and a pen. Friedman is about
to sign his name on the cover of the
book when A.J. stops him. “We
usually have the authors sign on the
title page if that’s fine with you.”
“Sorry,” Friedman replies,
“I’m new to this.”
“Not at all,” A.J. says.
“Would you mind telling me
what kind of show you’d like me to
put on out there?”
“Right,” A.J. says. “I’ll say a
couple of words about you and then
I thought you could introduce the

book, say what inspired you to
write it and such, then you could
maybe read a couple of pages and
then perhaps a Q and A with the
audience, if there’s time. Also,
we’re having a hat contest in honor
of the book, and we’d be honored if
you’d pick the winner.”
“Sounds fantastico,” Friedman
says. “Friedman. F-R-I-E-D-M-AN,” he says as he signs. “Easy to
forget that I.”
“Is it?” A.J. asks.
“Should be a second e there,
no?”
Authors are eccentric people
so A.J. decides to let this pass.

“You seem comfortable with
children,” A.J. says.
“Yeah . . . I often play Santa
Claus at the local Macy’s at
Christmas.”
“Really? That’s unusual.”
“I’ve got a knack for it, I
suppose.”
“I mean — ” A.J. pauses, trying
to decide if what he is about to say
will offend Friedman. “I only mean
because you’re Jewish.”
“Right-o.”
“You make a big point of it in
your book. Lapsed Jewish. Is that
the correct way of saying it?”
“You can say it any way you

want,” Friedman says. “Say, do you
have anything harder than wine?”
FRIEDMAN HAS HAD a couple of
drinks by the time the reading
commences, and A.J. supposes this
must be the reason the writer
garbles several of the longer proper
nouns
and foreign phrases:
Chappaqua, après moi le déluge,
Hadassah, L’chaim, challah, and so
on.
Some
writers
aren’t
comfortable reading aloud. During
the Q&A, Friedman keeps his
answers brief.
Q: What was it like when your
wife died?
A: Sad. Damned sad.

Q: What’s your favorite
book?
A: The Bible. Or Tuesdays
with Morrie. Probably the Bible,
though.
Q: You look younger than
your picture.
A: Why, thank you!
Q: What was it like working
at a newspaper?
A: My hands were always
dirty.
He’s more at home when
picking the best hat and during the
signing line. A.J.’s managed to get a
respectable turnout, and the line
extends out the door. “You should

have set up corrals like we do at
Macy’s,” Friedman suggests.
“Corrals are rarely necessary
in my line of work,” A.J. says.
Amelia and her mother are the
last to have their books signed.
“It’s really great to meet you,”
Amelia says. “My boyfriend and I
probably wouldn’t have gotten
together if not for your book.”
A.J. feels for the engagement
ring in his pocket. Is this the
moment? No, too Jumbotron.
“Give me a hug,” Friedman
tells Amelia. She leans over the
table, and A.J. thinks he sees the
old man look down Amelia’s

blouse.
“That’s the power of fiction
for you,” Friedman says.
Amelia studies him. “I
suppose.” She pauses. “Only it isn’t
fiction, right? It really happened.”
“Yes, sweetheart, of course,”
Friedman says.
A.J. interrupts. “Perhaps, Mr.
Friedman meant to say that that is
the power of narrative.”
Amelia’s mother, who is the
size of a grasshopper and has the
personality of a praying mantis,
says, “Perhaps Mr. Friedman is
trying to say that a relationship
based on loving a book is not likely

to be much of a relationship.”
Amelia’s mother, then, offers her
hand to Mr. Friedman. “Margaret
Loman. My spouse died a couple of
years ago, too. Amelia, my
daughter, made me read your book
for my Widows of Charleston Book
Club. Everyone thought it was
marvelous.”
“Oh, how nice. How . . .”
Friedman smiles brightly at Mrs.
Loman. “How . . . ”
“Yes?” Mrs. Loman repeats.
Friedman clears his throat,
then wipes sweat from his brow
and nose. Flushed, he looks even
more like Santa Claus. He opens his

mouth as if to speak, then throws up
all over the pile of just signed stock
and Amelia’s mother’s beige
Ferragamo pumps. “I seem to have
had too much to drink,” Friedman
says. He belches.
“Obviously,”
says
Mrs.
Loman.
“Mom, A.J.’s apartment is up
here.” Amelia points her mother
toward the stairs.
“He lives above the store?”
Mrs. Loman asks. “You never
mentioned that delightful piece of
 — ” At that moment, Mrs. Loman
slips in the rapidly expanding vomit
puddle. She rights herself, but her

hat, which had taken honorable
mention, is a lost cause.
Friedman turns to A.J.
“Apologies, sir. I seem to have had
too much to drink. A cigarette and
some fresh air sometimes settles my
stomach. If someone could point me
outside . . .” A.J. leads Friedman
out the back way.
“What happened?” Maya asks.
Once the Friedman talk had turned
out not to be to her interests, she
had turned her attentions back to
The Lightning Thief. She walks
over to the signing table and, upon
seeing the throw-up, vomits herself.
Amelia rushes to Maya’s side.

“Are you all right?”
“I did not expect to see that
there,” Maya says.
Meanwhile, in the alley to the
side of the store, Leon Friedman is
throwing up again.
“Do you think maybe you have
food poisoning?” A.J. asks.
Friedman doesn’t answer.
“Maybe it was the ferry ride
that did it? Or all the excitement?
The heat?” A.J. doesn’t know why
he feels the need to talk so much.
“Mr. Friedman, perhaps I can get
you something to eat?”
“You got a lighter?” Friedman
says hoarsely. “I left mine in my

bag inside.”
A.J. runs back in the store. He
can’t find Friedman’s bag. “I NEED
A LIGHTER!” he yells. He rarely
raises his voice. “Seriously, does
anyone work here who can get me a
lighter?”
But everyone is gone, aside
from a clerk, who’s occupied at the
cash register, and a couple of
stragglers from the Friedman
signing. A smartly dressed woman
of about Amelia’s age, opens her
capacious leather handbag. “I might
have one.”
A.J. stands there, seething
while the woman searches through

the purse, which is really more like
luggage. He thinks that this is why
one shouldn’t let authors into the
stores. The woman comes up
empty-handed. “Sorry,” she says. “I
quit smoking after my father died of
emphysema, but I thought I might
still have the lighter.”
“No, it’s fine. I have one
upstairs.”
“Is something wrong with the
writer?” the woman asks.
“The usual,” A.J. says,
heading up the stairs.
In his apartment, he finds
Maya by herself. Her eyes look
moist. “I threw up, Daddy.”

“I’m sorry.” A.J. locates the
lighter in his drawer. He slams the
drawer shut. “Where’s Amelia?”
“Are you going to propose?”
Maya asks.
“No, darling. Not at this
particular moment. I’ve got to
deliver a lighter to an alcoholic.”
She considers this information.
“Can I come with you?” she asks.
A.J. puts the lighter in his
pocket and, for expediency, scoops
up Maya, who really is too big to
be carried.
They go down the stairs and
through the bookstore and outside to
where A.J. had left Friedman.

Friedman’s head is haloed by
smoke. The pipe, which droops
languorously from his fingers,
makes a curious bubbling sound.
“I couldn’t find your bag,” A.J.
says.
“Had it with me all along,”
Friedman says.
“What kind of pipe is that?”
Maya asks. “I have never seen a
pipe like that before.”
A.J.’s first impulse is to cover
Maya’s eyes, but then he laughs.
Had Friedman actually traveled on
the plane with drug paraphernalia?
He turns to his daughter. “Maya, do
you remember when we read

Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
last year?”
“WHERE’S FRIEDMAN?” AMELIA

asks.
“Passed out in the backseat of
Ismay’s SUV,” A.J. replies.
“Poor Ismay.”
“She’s used to it. She’s been
Daniel Parish’s media escort for
years.” A.J. makes a face. “I think
the decent thing would be for me to
go with them.” The plan had been
for Ismay to drive Friedman to the
ferry and then the airport, but A.J.
can’t do that to his sister-in-law.
Amelia kisses him. “Good
man. I’ll watch Maya and clean up

here,” she says.
“Thank you. It sucks, though,”
A.J. says. “Your last night in town.”
“Well,” she says, “at least it
was memorable. Thanks for
bringing Leon Friedman even if
he’s a bit different than I imagined
him.”
“Just a bit.” He kisses Amelia
then furrows his brow. “I thought
this was going to be more romantic
than it turned out to be.”
“It was very romantic. What’s
more romantic than a lecherous old
drunk looking down my blouse?”
“He’s more than a drunk . . .”
A.J. mimes the universal gesture for

toking up.
“Maybe he has cancer or
something?” Amelia says.
“Maybe . . .”
“At least he waited until the
event was over,” she says.
“And I, for one, think the event
was the worse for it,” A.J. says.
Ismay honks the car horn.
“That’s me,” A.J. says. “Do
you really have to spend the night at
the hotel with your mother?”
“I don’t have to. I am a grown
woman, A.J.,” Amelia says. “It’s
just that we’re leaving early for
Providence tomorrow.”
“I don’t think I made a very

good impression,” A.J. says.
“No one does,” she says. “I
wouldn’t worry about it.”
“Well, wait up for me, if you
can.” Ismay honks the horn again,
and A.J. runs to the car.
Amelia begins cleaning up the
bookstore. She starts with the vomit
and has Maya round up less
objectionable detritus like flower
petals and plastic cups. In the back
row sits the woman who hadn’t had
a lighter. She wears a floppy gray
fedora and a silky maxidress. Her
clothes look like they could be from
a thrift shop, but Amelia, who
actually shops in thrift shops,

recognizes them as expensive.
“Were you here for the reading?”
Amelia asks.
“Yes,” the woman says.
“What did you think?” Amelia
asks.
“He was very animated,” the
woman says.
“Yes, that’s true.” Amelia
squeezes a sponge into a bucket. “I
can’t say he was completely what I
was expecting.”
“What were you expecting?”
the woman asks.
“Someone more intellectual, I
think. That sounds snobby. Maybe
that’s not the right word. Someone

wiser maybe.”
The woman nods. “No, I can
see that.”
“My
expectations
were
probably too high. I work for his
publisher. It was my favorite thing I
ever sold, actually.”
“Why was it your favorite?”
the woman asks.
“I . . .” Amelia looks at the
woman. She has kind eyes. Amelia
has often been fooled by kind eyes.
“I had lost my father not long
before, and I guess something in the
voice reminded me of him. Also,
there were so many true, true things
in it.” Amelia moves onto sweeping

the floor.
“Am I in your way?” the
woman asks.
“No, you’re fine where you
are.”
“I feel bad just watching you,”
the woman says.
“I like sweeping, and you’re
dressed too nicely to help.” Amelia
sweeps the room in long, rhythmic
strokes.
“They make the publisher
clean up after readings?” the
woman asks.
Amelia laughs. “No. I’m the
bookstore owner’s girlfriend, too.
I’m helping out for the day.”

The woman nods. “He must
have been a huge fan of the book to
bring Leon Friedman here after all
these years.”
“Yes.” Amelia lowers her
voice to a whisper. “The truth is, he
did it for me. It was the first book
we loved together.”
“That’s cute. Kind of like the
first restaurant you go to or the first
song you danced to or something.”
“Exactly.”
“Maybe he’s planning to
propose to you?” the woman says.
“The thought had crossed my
mind.”
Amelia empties the dustpan

into the garbage can.
“Why don’t you think the book
sold?” the woman asks after a bit.
“The Late Bloomer? Well . . .
because it’s competitive out there.
And even when a book is good,
sometimes it still doesn’t work.”
“That must be hard,” the
woman says.
“Are you writing a book or
something?”
“I’ve tried, yes.”
Amelia pauses to look at the
woman. She has long brown hair,
well cut and super straight. Her
purse probably costs as much as
Amelia’s car. Amelia holds out her

hand to introduce herself to the
woman. “Amelia Loman.”
“Leonora Ferris.”
“Leonora. Like Leon,” Maya
pipes up. She has had a milkshake
and is now recovered. “I am Maya
Fikry.”
“Are you from Alice?” Amelia
asks Leonora.
“No, I came in for the day. For
the reading.”
Leonora stands, and Amelia
folds her chair and sets it by the
wall.
“You must be a big fan of the
book, too,” Amelia says. “Like I
said before, my boyfriend lives

here, and I know from experience
that Alice isn’t the easiest place in
the world to get to.”
“No, it isn’t,” Leonora says as
she picks up her handbag.
All at once, Amelia is struck
with a thought. She turns around and
calls, “No one travels without
purpose. Those who are lost wish
to be lost.”
“You’re
quoting The Late
Bloomer,” Leonora says after a
long pause. “It really was your
favorite.”
“It was,” Amelia says. “
‘When I was young, I never felt
young.’ Something like that. Do you

remember the rest of the quote?”
“No,” Leonora says.
“Writers don’t remember
everything they write,” Amelia
says. “How could they?”
“Nice talking to you.” Leonora
starts heading for the door.
Amelia puts her hand on
Leonora’s shoulder.
“You’re him, aren’t you?”
Amelia says. “You’re Leon
Friedman.”
Leonora shakes her head. “Not
truly.”
“What does that mean?”
“A long time ago, a girl wrote
a novel, and she tried to sell it, but

no one wanted it. It was about an
old man who lost his wife, and it
didn’t have supernatural beings in it
or a high concept to speak of, and
so she thought it would be easier if
she retitled the book and called it a
memoir.”
“That’s . . . That’s . . . wrong,”
Amelia stammers.
“No, it isn’t. All the things in it
are still emotionally true even if
they aren’t literally so.”
“So who was that man?”
“I called a casting office. He
usually plays Santa.”
Amelia shakes her head. “I
don’t understand. Why do the

reading? Why go to the expense and
bother? Why risk it?”
“The book had already
flopped. And sometimes you want
to know . . . to see for yourself that
your work has meant something to
someone.”
Amelia looks at Leonora. “I
feel a little fooled,” she says
finally. “You’re a good writer, you
know?”
“I do know,” Leonora says.
Leonora Ferris disappears
down the street and Amelia goes
back into the store.
Maya says to her, “It has been
a very weird day.”

“I agree.”
“Who was that woman, Amy?”
Maya asks.
“Long story,” Amelia tells her.
Maya makes a face.
“She was distantly related to
Mr. Friedman,” Amelia says.
Amelia gets Maya into bed
then pours herself a drink and
debates whether or not to tell A.J.
about Leonora Ferris. She doesn’t
want to sour him on the idea of
author events. She also doesn’t
want to make herself look foolish in
his eyes or compromise herself
professionally: she has sold him a
book that has now revealed itself to

be a fake. And maybe Leonora
Ferris is right. Maybe it doesn’t
matter if the book is, strictly
speaking, true. She thinks back to a
sophomore seminar she had taken in
literary theory. What is true? the
teaching fellow would ask them.
Aren’t memoirs constructions
anyway? She would always fall
asleep during this class, which was
embarrassing because only nine
people were in it. All these years
later, Amelia finds she can still
drift off to the memory.
A.J. arrives back to the
apartment a little after ten. “How
was the drive?” Amelia asks.

“The best thing I can say is that
Friedman was passed out for most
of it. I’ve spent the last twenty
minutes cleaning Ismay’s backseat,”
A.J. reports.
“Well, I certainly look
forward to your next author event,
Mr. Fikry,” Amelia says.
“Was it that much of a
disaster?”
“No. I think everyone had a
great time, actually. And the store
did sell a lot of books.” Amelia
stands to leave. If she doesn’t leave
now, she won’t be able to resist
telling A.J. about Leonora Ferris. “I
should get back to the hotel. Since

we’re leaving so early tomorrow.”
“No, wait. Stay a bit.” A.J.
feels for the jewelry box in his
pocket. He doesn’t want the summer
to end without having asked her,
come what may. He is about to miss
his moment. He plucks the box from
his pocket and throws it at her.
“Think quick,” he says.
“What?” she says as she turns.
The jewelry box hits her smack in
the middle of the forehead. “Ow.
What the fuck, A.J.?”
“I was trying to get you not to
leave. I thought you’d catch it. I’m
sorry.” He goes over to her and
kisses her on the head.

“You threw a little high.”
“You’re taller than me. I
sometimes overestimate by how
much.”
She picks up the box from the
floor and opens it.
“It’s for you,” A.J. says. “It’s .
. .” He gets down on one knee,
clasps her hand between his, and
tries not to feel phony, like an actor
in a play. “Let’s get married,” he
says with an almost pained
expression. “I know I’m stuck on
this island, that I’m poor, a single
father, and in a business with
somewhat diminishing returns. I
know that your mother hates me,

that I’m quite obviously crap when
it comes to hosting author events.”
“This is an odd proposal,” she
says. “Lead with your strong stuff,
A.J.”
“All I can say is . . . All I can
say is we’ll figure it out, I swear.
When I read a book, I want you to
be reading it at the same time. I
want to know what would Amelia
think of it. I want you to be mine. I
can promise you books and
conversation and all my heart,
Amy.”
She knows that what he says is
true. He is, for the reasons he’s
said, a terrible match for her or

anybody else for that matter. The
travel is going to be murder. This
man, this A.J., is prickly and
argumentative. He thinks he is never
wrong. Maybe he never is wrong.
But he had been wrong.
Infallible A.J. had not sniffed out
Leon Friedman as a fraud. She’s not
sure why this matters at this
moment, but it does. Maybe it is
evidence
of
some
boyish,
delusional part of him. She cocks
her head. I will keep this secret
because I love you. As Leon
Friedman (Leonora Ferris?) once
wrote, “A good marriage is, at
least, one part conspiracy.”

She furrows her brow, and
A.J. thinks she is going to say no.
“A good man is hard to find,” she
says finally.
“Do you mean the O’Connor
story? The one on your desk. It’s an
awfully dark thing to bring up at a
time like this.”
“No, I mean you. I’ve been
looking forever. It was only two
trains and a boat away.”
“You can skip some of the
trains if you drive,” A.J. tells her.
“And what would you know
about driving?” Amelia asks.
THE NEXT FALL, just after the
leaves have turned, Amelia and A.J.

get married.
Lambiase’s mother, who has
come as his date, says to her son, “I
like all weddings, but isn’t it
particularly lovely when two
grown-ups decide to get married?”
Lambiase’s mother would like to
see her son remarry some day.
“I know what you mean, Ma.
Doesn’t seem like they’re going in
with their eyes closed,” Lambiase
says. “He knows she isn’t perfect.
She knows he definitely isn’t
perfect. They know there’s no such
thing as perfect.”
Maya has chosen to be ring
bearer because the job has more

responsibility than flower girl. “If
you lose a flower, you get another
flower,” Maya reasons. “If you lose
the ring, everyone is sad forever.
The ring bearer has much more
power.”
“You sound like Gollum,” A.J.
says.
“Who’s Gollum?” Maya wants
to know.
“Someone very nerdy that your
father likes,” Amelia says.
Before the service, Amelia
gives Maya a present: a small box
of bookplates that read THIS BOOK
BELONGS
FIKRY.

TO

MAYA

TAMERLANE

At this stage in her life,

Maya is fond of things with her
name on them.
“I’m glad we’re going to be
related,” Amelia says. “I really like
you, Maya.”
Maya is occupied with pasting
her first bookplate into the book
she’s
currently
reading, The
Astonishing Life of Octavian
Nothing. “Yeah,” she says. “Oh,
wait.” She takes a bottle of orange
nail polish from her pocket. “For
you.”
“I don’t have any orange,”
Amelia says. “Thank you.”
“I know. That’s why I picked
it.”

Amy turns the bottle over and
reads the bottom: A Good Mandarin Is Hard to Find.
A.J. had suggested inviting
Leon Friedman to the wedding, an
idea Amelia rejects. They do agree
on a passage from The Late
Bloomer to be read at the service
by one of Amelia’s college friends.
“It is the secret fear that we
are unlovable that isolates us,” the
passage goes, “but it is only
because we are isolated that we
think we are unlovable. Someday,
you do not know when, you will be
driving down a road. And someday,
you do not know when, he, or

indeed she, will be there. You will
be loved because for the first time
in your life, you will truly not be
alone. You will have chosen to not
be alone.”
None of Amelia’s other
college friends recognize the
woman who is reading the passage,
but none of them find this
particularly odd either. Vassar is a
small college, though certainly not
the kind of place where everyone
can know everyone, and Amelia has
always had a knack for making
friends with people from a variety
of social circles.

Chapter 7. The Girls in Their Summer Dresses
1939 / Irwin Shaw
Man watches women besides his
wife. The wife doesn’t approve. Lovely
twist, more like a turn, at the end.
You’re a good reader, and you’ll
probably see it coming. (Is a twist less
satisfying if you know it’s coming? Is a
twist
that
you
can’t
predict
symptomatic of bad construction?
These are things to consider when
writing.)
Not particularly apropos of writing
but . . . Someday, you may think of
marrying. Pick someone who thinks
you’re the only person in the room.
 — A.J.F.

Ismay waits in the foyer of her
house. Her legs are crossed so that
one foot is wrapped around the calf
of her other leg. She once saw an
anchorwoman sit that way, and it
had impressed her. A woman needs
skinny legs and flexible knees to
accomplish it. She wonders if the
dress she’s picked for the day will
be too light. The material is silk,
and summer is over.
She looks at her phone. It’s 11
a.m., which means the ceremony
will have already begun. Perhaps
she should leave without him?
As she is already late, she
decides that there is no point in

going alone. If she waits, she can
yell at him when he arrives. She
finds pleasure where she can.
Daniel comes through the door
at 11:26. “Sorry,” he says. “A few
of the kids from my class wanted to
go for a drink. One thing led to
another, you know how it is.”
“Yes,” she says. She doesn’t
feel like yelling anymore. Silence
will be better.
“I crashed in my office. My
back is killing me.” He kisses her
on the cheek. “You look fantastic.”
He whistles. “You still have great
legs, Izzie.”
“Get changed,” she says. “You

smell like a liquor store. Did you
drive here yourself?”
“I’m not drunk. I’m hungover.
Be precise, Ismay.”
“It’s amazing you’re still
alive,” she says.
“Probably so,” he says as he
goes up the stairs.
“Would you grab my wrap
when you come back down?” she
says, but she isn’t sure if he has
heard her.
THE WEDDING IS, as weddings
are, as weddings will always be,
Ismay thinks. A.J. looks sloppy in
his blue seersucker suit. Couldn’t
he have rented a tuxedo? It’s Alice

Island, not the Jersey shore. And
where had Amelia gotten that awful
Renaissance Faire dress? It’s more
yellow than white, and she looks
hippy in it. She’s always wearing
vintage clothes and she doesn’t
exactly have the right body type for
them. Who’s she kidding with those
big gerbera in her hair — she’s not
twenty, for God’s sake. When she
smiles, she’s all gums.
When did I get so negative?
Ismay wonders. Their happiness is
not her unhappiness. Unless it is.
What if there is only an equal ratio
of happiness to unhappiness in the
world at any given time? She

should be nicer. It’s a well-known
fact that hate shows up on your face
once you’re forty. Besides, Amelia
is attractive, even if she isn’t
beautiful like Nic. Look how much
Maya is smiling. Lost another tooth.
And A.J. is so happy. Watch that
lucky bastard try not to cry.
I s ma y is happy for A.J.,
whatever that means, but the
wedding itself is a trial. The event
makes her younger sister seem even
deader and also leads to unwanted
reflection
on
her
sundry
disappointments. She is forty-four
years old. She is married to a toohandsome man, whom she no longer

loves. She has had seven
miscarriages in the last dozen years.
She is, according to her
gynecologist, in perimenopause: So
much for that.
She looks across the venue at
Maya. What a pretty girl she is, and
she’s smart, too. Ismay waves to
her, but Maya has her head in a
book and she doesn’t seem to
notice. The little girl has never
particularly warmed to Ismay,
which everyone thinks is odd. In
general, Maya prefers adult
company, and Ismay, who has been
teaching for twenty years, is good
with children. Twenty years. Jesus.

Without even noticing it, she has
gone from the bright new teacher
whose legs all the boys stare at to
old Mrs. Parish who does the
school play. They think it’s silly
how much she cares about these
productions. Of course, they are
overestimating her investment. How
many years can she be expected to
go on, one mediocre production
blending in with the next? Different
faces, but none of these kids ever
turns out to be Meryl Streep.
Ismay pulls her wrap tighter
around her shoulders and decides to
take a walk. She heads down the
pier then takes off her kitten heels

and walks across the beach, which
is empty. It is late September, and
the air feels like fall. She tries to
remember the name of the book
where the woman swims out to sea
and kills herself in the end.
It would be so easy, Ismay
thinks. You walk out. You swim for
a while. You swim too far. You
don’t try to swim back. Your lungs
fill up. It hurts for a bit, but then it’s
over. Nothing ever hurts again, and
your conscience is clear. You don’t
leave a mess. Maybe your body
washes up some day. Maybe it
doesn’t. Daniel wouldn’t even look
for her. Maybe he would look for

her, but he certainly wouldn’t look
very hard.
Of course! The book is The
Awakening by Kate Chopin. How
she had loved that novel (novella?)
at seventeen.
Maya’s mother had ended her
life in the same fashion, and Ismay
wonders, not for the first time, if
Marian Wallace had read The
Awakening. She has thought a lot
about Marian Wallace over the
years.
Ismay walks into the water,
which is even colder than she
thought it would be. I can do this,
she thinks. Just keep walking.

I may just do this.
“Ismay!”
Despite herself, Ismay turns.
It’s Lambiase, that annoying cop
friend of A.J.’s. He is carrying her
shoes.
“Cold for a swim?”
“A little,” she replies. “I came
out here to clear my head.”
Lambiase walks over to her.
“Sure.”
Ismay’s teeth are chattering,
and Lambiase takes off his suit coat
and puts it over her shoulders.
“Must be hard,” Lambiase says.
“Seeing A.J. married to someone
other than your sister.”

“Yes. Amelia seems lovely,
though.” Ismay begins to cry, but the
sun has mostly set and she is not
sure if Lambiase can see it.
“The thing about weddings,”
he says, “is that they can make a
person feel lonely as hell.”
“Yes.”
“I hope I’m not out of line here
and I know we don’t know each
other that well. But, well, your
husband’s an idiot. If I had a nicelooking professional woman like
you — ”
“You are out of line.”
“I’m sorry,” Lambiase says. “I
got no manners.”

Ismay nods. “I wouldn’t say
you have no manners,” she says.
“You did lend me your coat. Thank
you for that.”
“Fall comes fast on Alice,”
Lambiase says. “We should go back
inside.”
DANIEL IS TALKING up Amelia’s
maid of honor by the bar under
Pequod’s whale, which has been
wrapped with Christmas lights for
the occasion. Janine, a Hitchcock
blond in glasses, came up through
the publishing ranks with Amelia.
Daniel doesn’t know this, but
Janine has been given the task of
making sure the great writer doesn’t

get out of line.
For the wedding, Janine is
wearing a yellow gingham dress
that Amelia had picked out and paid
for. “I know you’ll never wear this
again,” Amelia had said.
“Hard color to pull off,”
Daniel says. “But you look great in
it. Janine, right?”
She nods.
“Janine the maid of honor.
Should I ask you what you do?”
Daniel says. “Or is that boring party
talk?”
“I’m an editor,” she says.
“Sexy and smart. What are
your books?”

“A picture book I edited about
Harriet Tubman was a Caldecott
Honor Book a couple of years ago.”
“Impressive,” Daniel says,
though in fact he is disappointed.
He is on the hunt for a new
publishing home. His sales aren’t
what they once were, and he
believes the people at his old
publisher aren’t doing enough for
him. He’d like to leave them before
they leave him. “That’s the top
prize, right?”
“It didn’t win. It got an honor.”
“I bet you’re a good editor,”
he says.
“Based on what?”

“Well, you wouldn’t let me
think your book won when it was
only a runner-up.”
Janine looks at her watch.
“Janine looks at her watch,”
Daniel says. “She is bored with the
old writer.”
Janine smiles. “Strike the
second sentence. Reader will know.
Show, don’t tell.”
“If you’re going to say things
like that, I need a drink.” Daniel
signals the bartender. “Vodka. Grey
Goose, if you have it. And a little
seltzer.” He turns to Janine. “For
you?”
“Glass of rosé.”

“ ‘Show, don’t tell’ is a
complete crock of shit, Janine the
maid of honor,” Daniel lectures her.
“It comes from Syd Field’s
screenplay books, but it doesn’t
have a thing to do with novel
writing. Novels are all tell. The
best ones at least. Novels aren’t
meant to be imitation screenplays.”
“I read your book when I was
in junior high,” Janine says.
“Oh, don’t tell me that. It
makes me feel ancient.”
“It was my mom’s favorite.”
Daniel pantomimes getting
shot through the heart. Ismay taps
him on the shoulder. “I’m going

home,” she whispers in his ear.
Daniel follows her out to the
car. “Ismay, hold up.”
Ismay drives because Daniel
is too drunk to drive. They live in
the Cliffs, the most expensive part
of Alice Island. All the houses have
views, and the road that leads to
them is uphill, twisty with many
blind spots, poorly lit, and lined
with yellow signs imploring
caution.
“You took that turn a little fast,
darling,” Daniel says.
She thinks about driving them
both off the road and into the ocean,
and the thought makes her happy,

happier than she would have been if
she’d only killed herself. She
realizes in that moment that she
doesn’t want to be dead. She wants
Daniel to be dead. Or at least gone.
Yes, gone. She’d settle for gone.
“I don’t love you anymore.”
“Ismay, you’re being absurd.
You always get like this at
weddings.”
“You are not a good man,”
Ismay says.
“I’m complex. And maybe I’m
not good, but I’m certainly not the
worst. It’s no reason to end a
perfectly average marriage,” Daniel
says.

“You’re the grasshopper, and
I’m the ant. And I’m tired of being
the ant.”
“That’s a rather juvenile
reference. I’m sure you can do
better.”
Ismay pulls the car over to the
side of the road. Her hands are
shaking.
“You are bad. And what’s
worse is, you’ve made me bad,”
she says.
“I don’t know what you’re
talking about.” A car whizzes by
them, close enough to rattle the
walls of the SUV. “Ismay, this is an
insane place to park. If you want to

argue, let’s drive home and do it
properly.”
“Every time I see her with A.J.
and Amelia, I’m sick. She should be
ours.”
“What?”
“Maya,” Ismay says. “If you’d
done the right thing, she’d be ours.
But you, you can never do anything
hard. And I let you be that way.”
She looks steadily at Daniel. “I
know that Marian Wallace was
your girlfriend.”
“That isn’t true.”
“Don’t lie! I know that she
came here to kill herself in your
front yard. I know that she left Maya

for you, but you either were too lazy
or too much of a coward to claim
her.”
“If you thought that was true,
why didn’t you do something?”
Daniel asks.
“Because it isn’t my job! I was
pregnant, and it wasn’t my
responsibility to clean up after your
affairs.”
Another car speeds past,
nearly sideswiping them.
“But if you’d been brave and
come to me, I would have adopted
her, Daniel. I would have forgiven
you and I would have taken her in. I
waited for you to say something, but

you never did. I waited for days,
then weeks, then years.”
“Ismay, you can believe what
you want, but Marian Wallace was
not my girlfriend. She was a fan
who came to a reading.”
“How stupid do you think I
am?”
Daniel shakes his head. “She
was a girl who came to a reading,
and a girl I slept with once. How
could I even be sure the child was
mine?” He tries to take Ismay’s
hand, but she pulls away.
“It’s funny,” Ismay says.
“Every last bit of love I had for you
is gone.”

“I still love you,” Daniel says.
At that moment, headlights catch the
rearview mirror.
The hit comes from behind,
knocking the car into the center of
the road so that it is crossing both
lanes of traffic.
“I think I’m okay,” Daniel
says. “Are you okay?”
“My leg,” she says. “It might
be broken.”
More headlights, this time
from the opposite side of the road.
“Ismay, you have to drive.” He
turns in time to see the truck. A
twist, he thinks.
In the first chapter of Daniel’s

famous first novel, the main
character is in a catastrophic car
accident. Daniel had struggled with
the section, because it occurred to
him that everything he knew about
horrible car accidents had come
from books he’d read and movies
he’d seen. The description he
finally settled on, after what must
have been fifty passes, never much
satisfied him. A series of fragments
in the style of modernist poets.
Apollinaire or Breton, maybe, but
not nearly as good as either.
Lights, bright enough to
dilate her eyes.
Horns, flaccid and come

too late.
Metal crumpling like
tissue.
The body was not in pain
but only because the body was
gone, elsewhere.
Yes, Daniel thinks just after
impact but before death, like that.
The passage hadn’t been as bad as
he had thought.

PART II

Chapter 8. A Conversation with My Father
1972 / Grace Paley
Dying father argues with daughter
about the “best” way to tell a story.
You’ll love this, Maya, I’m sure.
Maybe I’ll go downstairs and push it
into your hands right now.
 — A.J.F.

The assignment for Maya’s
creative-writing class is to tell a
story about someone you wish you
knew better. “My biological father
is a ghost to me,” she writes. She
thinks the first sentence is good, but
where to go from there? After 250
words and a whole morning
wasted, she concedes defeat.
There’s no story because she
doesn’t know anything about the
man. He truly is a ghost to her. The
failure was in the conception.
A.J. brings her a grilled
cheese sandwich. “How’s it going,
Hemingway?”
“Don’t you ever knock?” she

says. She accepts the sandwich and
shuts the door. She used to love
living above the store, but now that
she is fourteen and Amelia lives
there, too, the apartment feels small.
And noisy. She can hear customer
downstairs all day. How is a
person to write under such
conditions?
Out of desperation, Maya
writes about Amelia’s cat.
Puddleglum never imagined
he’d move from Providence to
Alice Island.
She
revises, Puddleglum
never imagined he’d live in a
bookstore.

Gimmicky, she decides. That’s
what Mr. Balboni, the creative
writing teacher, will say. She has
already written a story from the
point of view of the rain and the
point of view of a very old library
book. “Interesting concepts,” Mr.
Balboni had written on the library
book story, “but you might want to
try writing about a human character
next time. Do you really want
anthropomorphizing to become your
thing?”
She had had to look up
“anthropomorphize”
before
deciding that, no, she didn’t want it
to become her thing. She doesn’t

want to have a thing. And yet can
she be blamed if it kind of is her
thing? Her childhood had been
spent reading books and imagining
lives for customers and sometimes
for inanimate objects like the teapot
or the bookmark carousel. It had not
been a lonely childhood, though
many of her intimates had been
somewhat less than real.
A little later, Amelia knocks.
“Are you working? Can you take a
break?”
“Come in,” Maya says.
Amelia flops onto the bed.
“What are you writing?”
“I don’t know. That’s the

problem. I thought I had an idea, but
it didn’t work.”
“Oh, that is a problem.”
Maya explains the assignment.
“It’s supposed to be about someone
important to you. Someone who
died, probably, or someone you
wish you knew better.”
“Maybe you could write about
your mother?”
Maya shakes her head. She
doesn’t want to hurt Amelia’s
feelings, but that seems kind of
obvious. “I know as little about her
as I do my biological father,” she
says.
“You lived with her for two

years. You know her name and
some of her backstory. That might
be a place to start.”
“I know as much as I want to
know about her. She had chances.
She screwed everything up.”
“That isn’t true,” Amelia says.
“She gave up, didn’t she?”
“She probably had reasons.
I’m sure she did the best she
could.” Amelia’s mother had died
two years ago, and though their
relationship had been challenging at
times, she misses her with an
unexpected ferocity. For instance,
until her death, her mother had sent
her new underwear in the mail

every other month. Amelia had not
once had to buy underwear her
whole life. Recently, she had found
herself standing in the lingerie
department at TJ Maxx, and as she
went through the panty bin, she had
begun to cry: No one will ever love
me that much again.
“Someone who died?” A.J.
says over dinner. “What about
Daniel Parish? You were good
friends with him.”
“When I was a child,” Maya
says.
“Isn’t he why you decided to
be a writer?” A.J. says.
Maya rolls her eyes. “No.”

“She had a crush on him when
she was little,” A.J. says to Amelia.
“Da-ad! That isn’t true.”
“Your first literary crush is a
big deal,” Amelia says. “Mine was
John Irving.”
“You lie,” A.J. says. “It was
Ann M. Martin.”
Laughing,
Amelia
pours
herself another glass of wine.
“Yeah, probably right.”
“I’m glad you both think this is
so funny,” Maya says. “I’m
probably going to fail and then I’ll
probably end up just like my
mother.” She stands up from the
table and runs to her room. Their

apartment is not built for dramatic
exits, and she bangs her knee on a
bookshelf. “This place is too
small,” she says.
She stalks into her room and
slams the door.
“Should I go after her?” A.J.
whispers.
“No. She needs space. She’s a
teenage girl. Let her stew for a bit.”
“Maybe she’s right,” A.J. says.
“This place is too small.”
They have been browsing
houses online for as long as they’ve
been married. Now that Maya is a
teenager, the attic apartment with its
one
bathroom
has
shrunk

exponentially, magically. Half the
time, A.J. finds himself using the
public store bathroom to avoid
competing with Maya and Amelia.
Customers are more civilized than
these two. Besides, business has
been good (or at least stable), and if
they moved, he could use the
apartment
for
an expanded
Children’s section with a story-time
area, or maybe gifts and greeting
cards.
In their price range on Alice
Island, all the houses are starter
homes, though A.J. feels like he is
past the starter home age of his life.
Weird kitchens and floorplans, too-

small rooms, ominous references to
foundation issues. Until the housing
search began, A.J. could count on
one hand the number of times he had
thought about Tamerlane with any
sort of regret.
Later that night, Maya finds a
slip of paper under her door:
Maya,
If you’re stuck, reading
helps:
“The Beauties” by Anton
Chekhov, “The Doll’s House”
by Katherine Mansfield, “A
Perfect Day for Bananafish”
by J. D. Salinger, “Brownies”
or
“Drinking
Coffee

Elsewhere” both by ZZ
Packer, “In the Cemetery
Where Al Jolson Is Buried” by
Amy Hempel, “Fat” by
Raymond Carver, “Indian
Camp” by Ernest Hemingway.
We should have them all
downstairs. Just ask if you
can’t find anything, though you
know where everything is
better than I.
Love,
Dad
She stuffs the list in her pocket
and walks downstairs, where the
store is closed for the night. She
spins the bookmark carousel — Why,

hello there, carousel! — and makes
a sharp right turn into Adult Fiction.
MAYA IS NERVOUS and a little
excited when she hands the story to
Mr. Balboni.
“ ‘A Trip to the Beach,’ ” he
says, reading the title.
“It’s from the point of view of
sand,” Maya says. “It’s winter on
Alice, and the sand misses the
tourists.”
Mr. Balboni shifts, and his
tight, black leather pants squeak. He
encourages them to emphasize the
positive while at the same time
reading with a critical and ideally
informed eye. “Well, that sounds

like it has evocative description
already.”
“I’m kidding, Mr. Balboni. I’m
trying to move away from
anthropomorphizing.”
“I’ll look forward to reading
it,” Mr. Balboni says.
The next week, Mr. Balboni
announces that he’s going to read a
story aloud, and everyone sits up a
little straighter. It is exciting to be
chosen even if it means being
criticized. It is exciting to be
criticized.
“What do we think?” he asks
the class when he’s finished.
“Well,” Sarah Pipp says, “no

offense, but the dialogue is kind of
bad. Like, I get what the person is
going for, but why doesn’t the
writer use contractions more?”
Sarah Pipp reviews books for her
blog, The Paisley Unicorn Book
Review. She is always bragging
about the free books she gets from
publishers. “And why third person?
Why present tense? It makes the
writing seem childish to me.”
Billy Lieberman, who writes
about wronged boy heroes who
overcome supernatural and parental
obstacles, says, “I don’t even get
what’s supposed to have happened
at the end? It’s confusing.”

“I think it’s ambiguous,” Mr.
Balboni says. “Remember last
week when we talked about
ambiguity?”
Maggie Markakis, who is only
in this elective because of a
scheduling conflict involving math
and debate, says she likes it, though
she notes discrepancies in the
financial elements of the stories.
Abner Shochet objects on
multiple fronts: he doesn’t like
stories in which characters lie (“I
am so done with unreliable
narrators” — the concept had been
introduced to them two weeks ago),
and worse, he thinks nothing

happens. This doesn’t hurt Maya’s
feelings because all of Abner’s
stories end with the same twist: that
everything had been a dream.
“Is there anything we liked
about it?” Mr. Balboni asks.
“The grammar,” Sarah Pipp
says.
John Furness says, “I liked
how sad it was.” John has long
brown eyelashes and a pop idol
pompadour. He wrote a story about
his grandmother’s hands that moved
even hard-hearted Sarah Pipp to
tears.
“Me too,” Mr. Balboni says.
“As a reader, I responded to many

of the things that you all objected to.
I liked the somewhat formal style
and the ambiguity. I disagree with
the comment about the ‘unreliable
narrators’ — we may have to go
over this concept again. I don’t
believe the financial elements were
handled badly either. All things
considered, I think this, along with
John’s story, ‘My Grandmother’s
Hands,’ are the two best stories
from class this semester, and they
will be the Alicetown High School
entries to the county story contest.”
Abner groans. “You didn’t say
who wrote the other one.”
“Right, of course. It’s Maya.

Round of applause for John and
Maya.”
Maya tries not to look too
pleased with herself.
“THAT’S AMAZING, RIGHT? Mr.
Balboni picking us,” John says after
class. He is following her to her
locker, though Maya cannot say
why.
“Yeah,” says Maya. “I liked
your story.” She had liked his story,
but she really wants to win. First
prize is a $150 gift certificate to
Amazon and a trophy.
“What would you buy if you
won?” John asks.
“Not books. I have those from

my dad.”
“You’re lucky,” John says. “I
wish I lived in the bookstore.”
“I live above it, not in it, and
it’s not that great.”
“I bet it is.”
He sweeps his brown hair out
of his eyes. “My mom wants to
know if you want to carpool to the
ceremony.”
“But we just found out today,”
Maya says.
“I know my mom. She always
likes to carpool. Ask your dad.”
“The thing is, my dad will
want to go, and he doesn’t drive. So
probably, Dad’ll get my godmother

or my godfather to drive us. And
your mom will want to go, too. So
I’m not sure if carpooling makes
sense.” She feels like she’s been
talking for about a half hour.
He smiles at her, which makes
his pompadour bounce a little. “No
problem. Maybe we could drive
you somewhere else sometime?”
THE AWARD CEREMONY is held
at a high school in Hyannis. Though
it’s just a gymnasium (the scent of
balls of both varieties is still
palpable) and the ceremony hasn’t
started yet, everyone speaks in
hushed tones, like it’s church.
Something important and literary is

about to happen here.
Of the forty entries from the
twenty high schools, only the top
three stories will be read aloud.
Maya has practiced reading her
story for John Furness. He
recommended that she breathe more
and slow down. She has been
practicing breathing and reading,
which are not as easy to do as one
might think. She had listened to him
read, too. Her advice to him was to
use his normal voice. He had been
doing this fake-y, newscaster thing.
“You know you love it,” he had
said. Now he talks to her in the fake
voice all the time. It’s so annoying.

Maya sees Mr. Balboni talking
to a person who can only be a
teacher from another school. She is
wearing teacher clothes — a floral
dress and a beige cardigan with
snowflakes embroidered on it, and
she is nodding adamantly at
whatever Mr. Balboni is saying. Of
course, Mr. Balboni is wearing his
leather pants, and because he is out,
a leather jacket — basically, a
leather suit. Maya wants to take him
to meet her father, because she
wants A.J. to hear Mr. Balboni
praise her. The balance is that she
doesn’t
want A.J.
to
be
embarrassing. She had introduced

A.J. to her English teacher, Mrs.
Smythe, at the store last month, and
A.J. had pressed a book into the
teacher’s hands saying, “You’ll
love this novel. It’s exquisitely
erotic.” Maya had wanted to die.
A.J. is wearing a tie, and
Maya jeans. She had put on a dress
that Amelia had chosen for her but
decided that the dress made it seem
like she cared too much. Amelia,
who is in Providence this week, is
meeting them there, but she’ll
probably run late. Maya knows
she’ll be sad about the dress.
A baton is tapped on the
podium. The teacher in the

snowflake sweater welcomes them
to the Island County High School
Short-Story Contest. She praises the
entries for having been a
particularly diverse and moving
group. She says she loves her job
and wishes everyone could win,
and then she announces the first
finalist.
Of course, John Furness would
be a finalist. Maya sits back in her
chair and listens. The story is better
than she remembers. She likes the
description of the grandmother’s
hands like tissue paper. She looks
at A.J. to see how it is playing with
him. He has a distant look in the

eyes, which Maya recognizes as
boredom.
The second story is by Virgina
Kim from Blackheart High. “The
Journey” is about an adopted child
from China. A.J. nods a couple of
times. She can tell he likes the story
better than “My Grandmother’s
Hands.”
Maya is starting to worry that
she won’t be picked at all. She is
glad she wore jeans. She turns
around to look for the quickest way
out. Amelia is standing by the door
of the auditorium. She gives Maya a
thumbs-up sign. “The dress. What
happened to the dress?” Amelia

mouths.
Maya shrugs, turns back to
listen to “The Journey.” Virginia
Kim wears a black velvet dress
with a white Peter Pan collar. She
reads in a very soft voice, barely
more than a whisper at times. It’s as
if she wants everyone to have to
lean in to listen.
Unfortunately, “The Journey”
is endless, five times as long as
“My Grandmother’s Hands,” and
after a while, Maya stops listening.
Maya guesses it probably takes less
time to fly to China.
If “A Trip to the Beach” isn’t
top three, there will be T-shirts and

cookies at the reception. But who
wants to stay for the reception if
you don’t at least place.
If she places, she won’t be
mad that she didn’t win.
If John Furness wins, she will
try not to hate him.
If Maya wins, maybe she will
donate the gift certificate to charity.
To, like, underprivileged kids or
orphanages.
If she loses, it will be okay.
She didn’t write the story to win a
prize or even complete an
assignment. If she’d wanted to
complete the assignment, she could
have written about Puddleglum.

Creative
writing is
graded
pass/fail.
The third story is announced,
and Maya grabs A.J.’s hand.

Chapter 9.  A Perfect Day for Bananafish
1948 / J. D. Salinger
If something is good and
universally acknowledged to be so,
this is not reason enough to dislike it.
(Side note: It has taken me all
afternoon to write this sentence. My
brain kept making hash of the phrase
“universally acknowledged.”)
“A Trip to the Beach,” your entry
for the county short-story contest,
reminds me a bit of Salinger’s story. I
mention this because I think you
should have won first place. The firstplace entry, which I believe was titled
“My Grandmother’s Hands,” was
much
simpler
both
formally,
narratively, and certainly emotionally
than yours. Take heart, Maya. As a

bookseller, I assure you that
prizewinning can be somewhat
important for sales but rarely matters
much in terms of quality.
 — A.J.F.
P.S. The thing I find most promising
about your short story is that it shows
empathy. Why do people do what they
do? This is the hallmark of great
writing.
P.P.S. If I have a criticism, perhaps
it’s that you might have introduced the
swimming element earlier.
P.P.P.S. Also, readers will know
what an ATM card is.

A Trip to the Beach
By Maya Tamerlane Fikry
Teacher: Edward Balboni, Alicetown High
School
Grade 9
Mary is running late. She has a private room,
but she shares the bathroom with six other
people, and it seems like someone is always
using it. When she gets back from the bathroom,
the babysitter is sitting on her bed. “Mary, I
have been waiting for you for five minutes.”
“I’m sorry,” Mary says. “I wanted to take a
shower, but I couldn’t get in.”
“It is already eleven,” the babysitter says.
“You’ve only paid me to be here until noon, and
I have somewhere I need to be at 12:15 p.m. So
you better not be late getting back.”
Mary thanks the babysitter. She kisses the
baby on the head. “Be good,” she says.
Mary runs across the campus to the English
department. She runs up the stairs. Her teacher
is already leaving by the time she gets there.

“Mary. I was just about to leave. I didn’t think
you were going to show. Please come in.”
Mary goes into the office. The teacher takes
out Mary’s homework and sets it on the desk.
“Mary,” the teacher says. “You used to get
straight A’s, and now you are failing all of your
classes.”
“I’m sorry,” Mary says. “I’ll try to do
better.”
“Is something happening in your life?” the
teacher asks. “You used to be one of our best
students.”
“No,” Mary says. She bites her lip.
“You have a scholarship to this college. You
are already in trouble because your grades have
been bad for a while, and when I tell the college,
they will probably end your scholarship or at
least make you leave for some time.”
“Please don’t do that!” Mary begs. “I don’t
have anywhere I can go. The only money I have
is my scholarship money.”
“It is for your own good, Mary. You should
go home and sort yourself out. Christmas is in a

couple of weeks. Your parents will understand.”
Mary is fifteen minutes late getting back to
the dorm. The babysitter is frowning when Mary
gets there. “Mary,” the babysitter says. “You
are late once again! When you’re late, it makes
me late for the things I have to do. I’m sorry. I
really like the baby, but I don’t think I can
babysit for you anymore.”
Mary takes the baby from the babysitter.
“Okay,” she says.
“Also,” the babysitter adds, “you owe me for
the last three times I babysat. It’s ten dollars an
hour so that’s thirty dollars.”
“Can I pay you next time?” Mary asks. “I
meant to go to the automated teller machine
(ATM) on my way back, but I didn’t have
time.”
The babysitter makes a face. “Just put it in
an envelope with my name on it and leave it at
my dorm. I would really like the money before
Christmas. I have presents to buy.”
Mary agrees.
“Bye, little baby,” the babysitter says. “Have

a great Christmas.”
The baby coos.
“Do you two have anything special planned
for the holidays?” the babysitter asks.
“I’ll probably take her to see my mom. She
lives in Greenwich, Connecticut. She always has
a big Christmas tree, and she makes a delicious
dinner, and there will be tons of presents for me
and for Myra.”
“That sounds really nice,” the babysitter
says.
Mary puts the baby in the baby sling, and she
walks to the bank. She checks the balance on
her ATM card. She has $75.17 in her checking
account. She takes out forty dollars and then she
goes inside to get change.
She puts thirty dollars in an envelope with the
babysitter’s name on it. She buys a token for the
subway and rides to the last stop on the train.
The neighborhood is not as nice as the
neighborhood where Mary’s college is.
Mary walks down the street. She comes to a
rundown house with a chain-link fence out front.

There is a dog tied to a post in the yard. It barks
at the baby, and the baby starts to cry.
“Don’t worry, baby,” Mary says. “The dog
can’t get you.”
They go inside the house. The house is very
dirty and there are kids everywhere. The kids
are dirty, too. The kids are noisy and all different
ages. Some of them are in wheelchairs or
disabled.
“Hi, Mary,” a disabled girl says. “What are
you doing here?”
“I’ve come to see Mama,” Mary says.
“She is upstairs. She is not feeling well.”
“Thank you.”
“Mary, is that your baby?” the disabled girl
asks.
“No,” Mary says. She bites her lip. “I’m just
watching it for a friend.”
“How is Harvard?” the disabled girl asks.
“Great,” Mary says.
“Bet you got all A’s.”
Mary shrugs.
“You are so modest, Mary. Still swimming

on the swim team?”
Mary shrugs again. She walks up the stairs
to see Mama.
Mama is a morbidly obese white woman.
Mary is a skinny black girl. Mama cannot be
Mary’s biological mother.
“Hi, Mama,”
Mary says. “Merry
Christmas.” Mary kisses the fat woman on the
cheek.
“Hi, Mary. Miss Ivy Leaguer. Didn’t expect
to see you back here at your foster home.”
“No.”
“Is that your baby?” Mama asks.
Mary sighs. “Yes.”
“What a shame,” Mama says. “Smart girl
like you, messing up her life. Didn’t I tell you to
never have sex? Didn’t I tell you to always use
protection?”
“Yes, Mama.” Mary bites her lip. “Mama,
would it be okay if the baby and I stayed here a
while? I’ve decided to take a leave from the
school to get my life organized. It would be very
helpful.”

“Oh, Mary. I wish I could help, but the house
is filled up. I don’t have a room for you. You are
too old for me to get a check from the state of
Massachusetts.”
“Mama, I don’t have anywhere else to go.”
“Mary, here is what I think you should do. I
think you should contact the baby’s father.”
Mary shakes her head. “I didn’t really know
him that well.”
“Then I think you should put the baby up for
adoption.”
Mary shakes her head again. “I can’t do that
either.”
Mary goes back to the dorm room. She
packs up a bag for the baby. She puts a stuffed
Elmo in the bag. A girl from down the hall
comes into Mary’s room.
“Hey Mary, where are you going?”
Mary smiles brightly. “I thought I would take
a trip to the beach,” she says. “The baby loves
the beach.”
“Isn’t it a little cold for the beach?” the girl
asks.

“Not really,” Mary says. “The baby and I
will wear our warmest clothes. Plus the beach is
really nice in the winter.”
The girl shrugs. “I guess.”
“When I was a little girl, my dad used to take
me to the beach all the time.”
Mary drops off the envelope at the
babysitter’s dorm. At the train station, she uses
her credit card to buy tickets for the train and
boat that go to Alice Island.
“You do not need a ticket for the baby,” the
ticket taker tells Mary.
“Good,” Mary says.
When she gets to Alice Island, the first place
Mary sees is a bookstore. She goes inside so
that she and the baby can warm up. A man is at
the counter. He has a grumpy demeanor and he
wears Converse sneakers.
Christmas music is playing in the store. The
song is “Have Yourself a Merry Little
Christmas.”
“This song makes me so sad,” a customer
says. “This is the saddest song I have ever

heard. Why would anyone write such a sad
Christmas song?”
“I’m looking for something to read,” Mary
says.
The man gets slightly less grumpy. “What
kind of books do you like?”
“Oh, all kinds, but my favorite kind of book is
the kind where a character has hardships but
overcomes them in the end. I know life isn’t like
that. Maybe that is why it is my favorite thing.”
The bookseller says that he has the perfect
thing for her, but by the time he gets back, Mary
is gone. “Miss?”
He leaves the book on the counter just in
case Mary decides to come back.
Mary is on the beach, but the baby is not
with her.
She used to swim on a swim team. She was
good enough to win the state championships in
high school. That day, the waves are choppy
and the water is cold, and Mary is out of
practice.
She swims out, past the lighthouse, and she

doesn’t swim back.
THE END

“Congratulations,” Maya tells
John Furness at the reception. She
is clutching her rolled-up T-shirt in
her hand. Amelia has Maya’s
certificate: third place.
John shrugs and his hair flops
back and forth. “I thought you
should have won, but it’s pretty
cool them picking two stories from
Alicetown as finalists.”
“Maybe Mr. Balboni is a good
teacher.”
“We can split my gift
certificate if you want,” John says.
Maya shakes her head. She

doesn’t want it that way.
“What would you have
bought?”
“I was going to give it to
charity. To underprivileged kids.”
“Seriously?” He does his
newscaster voice.
“My dad doesn’t really like us
to shop online.”
“You aren’t angry at me, are
you?” John says.
“No. I’m happy for you. Go
Whales!” She punches him on the
shoulder.
“Ow.”
“I’ll see you around. We’ve
got to catch the auto ferry back to

Alice.”
“So do we,” John says.
“There’s plenty of time for us to
hang out.”
“My dad has things to do at the
store.”
“See you at school,” John says
in the newscaster voice again.
In the car on the way home,
Amelia congratulates Maya for
placing and for writing an amazing
story, and A.J. says nothing.
Maya thinks that A.J. must be
disappointed in her, but just before
they get out of the car, he says,
“These things are never fair. People
like what they like, and that’s the

great and terrible thing. It’s about
personal taste and a certain set of
people on a certain day. For
instance, two out of the three
finalists were women, which might
have tipped the scales toward the
male. Or maybe one of the judges’
grandmothers died last week, which
made that story particularly
effective. One never knows. But
here is what I do know. ‘A Trip to
the Beach’ by Maya Tamerlane
Fikry was written by a writer.” She
thinks he’s about to hug her, but
instead he shakes her hand, the way
he would greet a colleague — 
perhaps an author visiting the store.

A sentence occurs to her: The
day my father shook my hand, I
knew I was a writer.
JUST BEFORE THE school year
ends, A.J. and Amelia make an
offer on a house. The house is about
ten minutes away from the store and
inland. Although it does have four
bedrooms, two bathrooms, and the
quiet A.J. believes a young writer
needs to work, the house is no one’s
idea of a dream house. The last
owner had died there — she hadn’t
wanted to leave, but she hadn’t
done much to maintain the house in
the last fifty or so years either. The
ceilings are low; there are several

different eras of wallpaper to be
stripped; the foundation is shaky.
A.J. calls it the “in ten years house”
meaning that “in ten years, it might
be livable.” Amelia calls it “a
project” and she sets herself to
working on it immediately. Maya,
having recently made her way
through The Lord of the Rings
trilogy, names it Bag End. “Because
it looks as if a hobbit might live
here.”
A.J. kisses his daughter on the
forehead. He is delighted to have
produced such a fantastic nerd.

Chapter 10. The Tell-Tale Heart
1843 / E. A. Poe
True!
Maya, perhaps you don’t know that
I had a wife before Amelia and a
profession before I became a
bookseller. I was once married to a
woman named Nicole Evans. I loved
her very much. She died in a car
accident, and a large part of me was
dead for a long time after, probably
until I found you.
Nicole and I met in college and
married the summer before we entered
graduate school. She wanted to be a
poet but in the meantime was
unhappily working toward a PhD in
twentieth-century
female
poets
(Adrienne Rich, Marianne Moore,
Elizabeth Bishop; how she hated
Sylvia Plath). I was well on my way to

a PhD in American literature. My
dissertation was to be on depictions of
disease in the works of E. A. Poe, a
subject I had never particularly liked
but had grown to truly despise. Nic
suggested that there could be better,
happier ways to have a literary life. I
said, “Yeah, like what?”
And she said, “Bookstore owners.”
“Tell me more,” I said.
“Did you know my hometown
doesn’t have a bookstore?”
“Really? Alice seems like the kind
of place that should have one.”
“I know,” she said. “A place is not
really a place without a bookstore.”
And so we quit grad school, took
her trust fund money, moved to Alice,
and opened the store that would
become Island Books.
Does it go without saying that we
did not know what we were getting
into?

In the years after Nicole’s accident,
I often imagined what my life might
have been like if I had finished that
PhD.
But I digress.
This is arguably the best known of
E. A. Poe’s stories. In a box marked
ephemera, you’ll find my notes and
twenty-five pages of my dissertation
(most of it concerning “The Tell-Tale
Heart”), if you’re ever interested in
reading more about the things your
dad did in another life.
 — A.J.F.

What bothers me in a story
more than anything is a loose end,”
Deputy Doug Lippman says,
selecting four mini-quiches from the
hors d’oeuvres Lambiase has
provided. After many years of
hosting the Chief’s Choice Book
Club, Lambiase knows that the most
important thing, even more than the
title at hand, is food and drink.
“Deputy,” Lambiase says, “it’s
a three-quiche max, or there won’t
be enough for everyone.”
The deputy puts a quiche back
on the tray. “Like, okay, what the
heck happened to the violin? Did I
miss something? A priceless

Stradivarius doesn’t vanish into thin
air.”
“Good point,” Lambiase says.
“Anyone?”
“You know what I freaking
hate,” Kathy from Homicide says.
“I freaking hate shoddy police
work. Like, when no one wears
gloves, I’m yelling, Shut up, you’re
contaminating the crime scene.”
“You never get that in
Deaver,” Sylvio from Dispatch
says.
“If only they could all be
Deaver,” Lambiase says.
“But what I hate more than bad
police work is when everything is

solved too quickly,” Homicide
Kathy continues. “Even Deaver
does it. Things take time to figure
out. Sometimes years. You got to
live with a case a long time.”
“Good point, Kathy.”
“These
mini-quiches
are
delicious, by the way.”
“Costco,” Lambiase says.
“I hate the women characters,”
Rosie the firefighter says. “The
policewomen are always ex-models
from families of cops. She’s got,
like, one flaw.”
“Bites her nails,” says
Homicide Kathy. “Unruly hair. Big
mouth.”

Rosie the firefighter laughs.
“It’s some fantasy of a lady in law
enforcement is what it is.”
“I dunno,” Deputy Dave says.
“I like the fantasy.”
“Maybe the writer’s point is
that the violin is not the point?”
Lambiase says.
“Of course it’s the point,” says
Deputy Dave.
“Maybe the point is how the
violin affects everyone’s lives?”
Lambiase continues.
“Boo,” Rosie the firefighter
says. She makes a thumbs-down
sign. “Booooo.”
From the counter, A.J. listens

to the discussion. Of the dozen or so
book groups Island hosts, Chief’s
Choice is his favorite by far.
Lambiase calls over to him, “Back
me up here, A.J. You don’t always
have to know who stole the violin.”
“In my experience, a book is
more satisfying to readers if you
do,” A.J. says. “Although I don’t
mind ambiguity myself.”
The groups’ cheers drown out
everything after the word do.
“Traitor,” Lambiase yells.
At that moment, the wind
chimes sound as Ismay enters the
store. The group goes back to
discussing the book, but Lambiase

can’t help staring at her. She has a
white summer dress on with a full
skirt that emphasizes her tiny waist.
She wears her red hair long again,
which softens her face. He is
reminded of the orchids that his exwife used to keep in the front
window.
Ismay goes up to A.J. She sets
a piece of paper on the counter.
“I’ve finally picked the play,” she
says. “I’ll probably need about fifty
copies of Our Town.”
“It’s a classic,” A.J. says.
Many years after Daniel
Parish’s death and a half hour after
Chief’s Choice, Lambiase decides

enough time has passed to make a
particular inquiry of A.J. “I hate to
overstep here, but would you check
if your sister-in-law is interested in
going on a date with a not-badlooking law enforcement officer?”
“To whom are you referring?”
“Me. I was kidding about the
not-bad-looking part. I know I’m
not exactly the blue-ribbon cow.”
“No, I meant who do you want
me to ask. Amelia is an only child.”
“Not Amelia. I mean, your exsister-in-law, Ismay.”
“Oh, right. Ismay.” A.J.
pauses. “Ismay? Really? Her?”
“Yeah, I’ve always kind of

had a thing for her. Going way back
to high school. Not that she ever
noticed me very much. I figure none
of us is getting any younger, so I
should take my chances now.”
A.J. calls Ismay on the phone
and makes the request.
“Lambiase?” she asks. “Him?”
“He’s a good guy,” A.J. says.
“It’s only . . . well, I’ve never
dated a police officer before,”
Ismay says.
“That’s starting to sound
awfully snobbish.”
“I don’t mean to sound that
way, but blue-collar men have
never been my type.”

And that worked out so well
with you and Daniel, A.J. thinks
but does not say.
“Of course, my marriage was a
disaster,” Ismay says.
SEVERAL EVENINGS LATER, she
and Lambiase are at El Corazon.
She orders the surf and turf, and a
gin and tonic. No need to put on a
show of femininity as she suspects
there won’t be a second date.
“Good appetite,” Lambiase
comments. “I’ll have the same.”
“So,” Ismay says, “what do
you do when you aren’t being a
cop?”
“Well, believe it or not,” he

says shyly, “I read a lot. Maybe you
wouldn’t think it’s that much. I
know you teach English.”
“What do you read?” Ismay
asks.
“Little bit of everything. I
started with crime novels. Pretty
predictable that, I guess. But then
A.J. got me into other kinds of
books, too. Literary fiction, I think
you’d call it. Some of it doesn’t
have enough action for my taste.
Kind of embarrassing, but I like
young adult. Plenty of action there
and feelings, too. I also read
whatever A.J.’s reading. He’s
partial to short stories — ”

“I know.”
“And
whatever
Maya’s
reading, too. I like talking about
books with them. They’re book
people, you know. I also host a
book group for the other cops.
Maybe you’ve seen the signs for the
Chief’s Choice?”
Ismay shakes her head.
“Sorry if I’m talking too much.
I’m nervous, I guess.”
“You’re fine.” Ismay sips her
drink. “Did you ever read any of
Daniel’s books?”
“Yeah, one. The first one.”
“Did you like it?”
“Not my cup of tea. It was

very well written, though.”
Ismay nods.
“Do you miss your husband?”
Lambiase asks.
“Not really,” she says after a
bit. “His sense of humor sometimes.
But the best parts of him were in his
books. I suppose I could always
read those if I missed him too much.
I haven’t wanted to read one yet,
though.” Ismay laughs a little.
“What do you read, then?”
“Plays, the odd bit of poetry.
Then there are the books I teach
every
year: Tess
of
the
d’Urbervilles, Johnny Got His
Gun, A Farewell to Arms, A Prayer

for Owen Meany, some years
Wuthering Heights, Silas Marner,
Their Eyes Were Watching God, or
I Capture the Castle. Those books
are like old friends.
“When I’m choosing something
new, though, something just for
myself, my favorite kind of
character is a woman in a faraway
place.
India.
Or
Bangkok.
Sometimes she leaves her husband.
Sometimes she never had a husband
because she knew, wisely, that
married life would not be for her. I
like when she has multiple lovers. I
like when she wears hats to block
her fair skin from the sun. I like

when she travels and has
adventures. I like descriptions of
hotels and suitcases with stickers
on them. I like descriptions of food
and clothes and jewelry. A little
romance but not too much. The story
is period. No cell phones. No
social networking. No Internet at
all. Ideally, it’s set in the 1920s or
the 1940s. Maybe there’s a war
going on, but it’s just a backdrop.
No bloodshed. Some sex but
nothing too graphic. No children.
Children often spoil a story for
me.”
“I don’t have any,” Lambiase
says.

“I don’t mind them in real life.
I just don’t want to read about them.
Endings can be happy or sad, I
don’t care anymore as long as it’s
earned. She can settle down, maybe
open a little business, or she can
drown herself in the ocean. Finally,
a nice-looking jacket is important. I
don’t care how good the insides
are. I don’t want to spend any length
of time with an ugly object. I’m
shallow, I guess.”
“You are one heck of a pretty
woman,” Lambiase says.
“I’m ordinary,” she says.
“No way.”
“Pretty is not a good reason to

court someone, you know. I have to
tell that to my students all the time.”
“This from the woman who
doesn’t read the books with the ugly
covers.”
“Well, I’m warning you. I
could be a bad book with a good
jacket.”
He groans. “I’ve known a few
of those.”
“For instance?”
“My first marriage. The wife
was pretty but mean.”
“So you thought you’d make
the same mistake twice?”
“Nah, I’ve seen you on the
shelf for years. I’ve read the

synopsis and the quotes on the back.
Caring
teacher.
Godmother.
Upstanding community member.
Caretaker to sister’s husband and
daughter. Bad marriage, probably
made too young, but tried her best.”
“Sketchy,” she says.
“But it’s enough to make me
want to read on.” He smiles at her.
“Should we order dessert?”
“I HAVEN’T HAD sex in a really
long time,” Ismay says in the car on
the way back to her house.
“Okay,” Lambiase says.
“I think we should have sex,”
Ismay clarifies. “If you want to, I
mean.”

“I do want to,” Lambiase says.
“But not if that means I don’t get to
take you on a second date. I don’t
want to be a warm-up for the guy
that gets you.”
She laughs at him and leads
him to her bedroom. She takes off
her clothes with the lights on. She
wants him to see what a fifty-oneyear-old woman looks like.
Lambiase lets out a low
whistle.
“You’re sweet, but you should
have seen me before,” she says.
“Surely you see the scars.”
A long one runs from her knee
to her hip. Lambiase runs his thumb

along it: it’s like a seam on a doll.
“Yeah, I see them, but it doesn’t
take away from anything.”
Her leg had been broken in
fifteen places and she’d had to have
the socket of her right hip replaced,
but other than that, she’d been fine.
For once in his life, Daniel had
taken the brunt of the impact.
“Does
it
hurt
much?”
Lambiase asks. “Should I be
careful?”
She shakes her head and tells
him to take off his clothes.
IN THE MORNING, she wakes
before him. “I’m going to make you
breakfast,” she says. He nods

sleepily, and then she kisses him on
his shaven head.
“Are you shaving this because
you’re balding or because you like
the style?” she asks.
“A little of both,” Lambiase
replies.
She sets a towel on the bed,
then leaves the room. Lambiase
takes his time getting ready. He
opens the drawer of her nightstand
and pokes around her things a bit.
She has expensive-looking lotions
that smell like her. He smears some
on his hands. He opens her closet.
Her clothes are tiny. There are silk
dresses, pressed cotton blouses,

wool pencil skirts, and paper-thin
cashmere cardigans. Everything is
in smart shades of beige and gray,
and the condition of her clothes is
immaculate. He looks at the top
shelf of the closet, where her shoes
are neatly organized in their
original boxes. Above one of the
stacks of shoes, he notices a small
child’s backpack in princess pink.
His cop eyes clock the child’s
backpack as out of place somehow.
He knows he shouldn’t, but he pulls
it down and unzips it. Inside is a
zipper case with crayons and a
couple of coloring books. He picks
up the coloring book. MAYA is

written across the front. Behind the
coloring book is another book. A
flimsy thing, more like a pamphlet
than a book. Lambiase looks at the
cover:
TAMERLANE
AND

OTHER POEMS.
BY A BOSTONIAN.
Crayon marks scar the cover.
Lambiase doesn’t know what
to make of it.
His cop brain clicks in,
formulating the following questions:
(1) Is this A.J.’s stolen Tamerlane?
(2) Why would Tamerlane be in
Ismay’s possession? (3) How did

Tamerlane get covered in crayon
and who did the coloring? Maya?
(4) Why would Tamerlane be in a
backpack with Maya’s name on it?
He is about to run downstairs
to demand an explanation from
Ismay, but then he changes his mind.
He looks at the ancient
manuscript for several seconds
longer.
He can smell the pancakes
from where he sits. He can imagine
her downstairs making them. She is
probably wearing a white apron
and a silky nightgown. Or maybe
she is wearing just the apron and
nothing else. That would be

exciting. Maybe they can have sex
again. Not on the kitchen table. It is
not comfortable to have sex on a
kitchen table no matter how erotic it
looks in movies. Maybe on the
couch. Maybe back upstairs. Her
mattress is so soft, and her sheets’
thread count must be in the
thousands.
Lambiase prides himself on
being a good cop, and he knows he
should go downstairs and make an
excuse to her now about why he has
to go.
But is that the sound of an
orange being juiced? Is she
warming syrup, too?

The book is ruined.
Besides which, it was stolen
so long ago. Over ten years now.
A.J. is happily married. Maya is
settled. Ismay has suffered.
Not to mention, he really likes
this woman. And none of this is
Lambiase’s business anyway. He
zips the book back into the
backpack and puts the bag back
where he found it.
Lambiase believes that cops
go one of two ways as they get
older. They either get more
judgmental or less so. Lambiase is
not so rigid as when he was a young
police officer. He has found that

people do all sorts of things, and
they usually have their reasons.
He goes downstairs and sits at
her kitchen table, which is round
and covered with the whitest
tablecloth he has ever seen. “Smells
great,” he says.
“Nice to have someone to
cook for. You were up there a long
time,” she says, pouring him a glass
of fresh-squeezed orange juice. Her
apron is turquoise, and she is
wearing black exercise clothes.
“Hey,” Lambiase says, “did
you happen to read Maya’s short
story for the contest? I thought the
kid should have been a shoo-in to

win.”
“I haven’t read it yet,” Ismay
says.
“It’s basically Maya’s version
of the last day of her mother’s life,”
Lambiase says.
“She’s so precocious,” Ismay
says.
“I’ve always wondered why
Maya’s mother chose Alice.”
Ismay flips a pancake, and then
she flips another. “Who knows why
people do what they do?”

Chapter 11. Ironhead
2005 / Aimee Bender
For the record, everything new is
not worse than everything old.
Parents with heads made from
pumpkins have a baby with a head
made from iron. I have, for what I
assume will be very obvious reasons,
been thinking about this one a lot
lately.
 — A.J.F.
P.S. I also find myself thinking of
“Bullet in the Brain” by Tobias Wolff.
You might give that a read, too.

Christmas
brings
A.J.’s
mother, who looks nothing like him.
Paula is a tiny white woman with
long gray hair that has not been cut
since she retired from her job at a
computer company a decade ago.
She has made the most of her
retirement in Arizona. She makes
jewelry out of rocks that she paints.
She teaches literacy to inmates. She
rescues Siberian huskies. She tries
to go to a different restaurant every
week. She dates some — women and
men. She has slipped into
bisexuality without needing to make
a big thing about it. She is seventy,
and she believes you try new things

or you may as well die. She comes
bearing three identically wrapped
and shaped presents for the family
and a promise that it isn’t
thoughtlessness that has led her to
pick the same gift for the three of
them. “It’s something I thought the
whole family would appreciate and
use,” she says.
Maya knows what it is before
she’s even through the paper.
She’s seen them at school.
Almost everyone seems to have one
these days, but her dad doesn’t
approve. She slows down her
unwrapping speed to allow herself
time to figure out the response that

will least offend both her
grandmother and her father.
“An e-reader! I’ve wanted one
for a really long time.” She shoots a
quick look over to her father. He
nods, though his eyebrow is
twitching slightly. “Thanks, Nana.”
Maya kisses her grandmother on the
cheek.
“Thank you, Mother Fikry,”
says Amelia. She already has an ereader for work, but she keeps this
information to herself.
As soon as he sees what it is,
A.J. decides to stop unwrapping the
present. If he keeps it in the paper,
perhaps it can be given to someone

else. “Thank you, Mother,” A.J.
says, and then he bites his tongue.
“A.J., you have a moue,” his
mother notes.
“I don’t,” he insists.
“You must keep up with the
times,” she continues.
“Why must I? What is so great
about the times?” A.J. has often
reflected that, bit by bit, all the best
things in the world are being carved
away like fat from meat. First, it
had been the record stores, and then
the video stores, and then
newspapers and magazines, and
now even the big chain bookstores
were disappearing everywhere you

looked. From his point of view, the
only thing worse than a world with
big chain bookstores was a world
with NO big chain bookstores. At
least the big stores sell books and
not pharmaceuticals or lumber! At
least some of the people who work
at those stores have degrees in
English literature and know how to
read and curate books for people!
At least the big stores can sell ten
thousand units of publisher’s dreck
so that Island gets to sell one
hundred units of literary fiction!
“The easiest way to get old is
to be technologically behind, A.J.”
After
twenty-five
years
in

computers, his mother had come
away with a respectable pension
and this one opinion, A.J. thinks
uncharitably.
A.J. takes a deep breath, a
long drink of water, another deep
breath. His brain feels tight against
his skull. His mother visits rarely,
and he doesn’t want to spoil their
time together.
“Dad, you’re turning a bit
red,” Maya says.
“A.J., are you unwell?” his
mother asks.
He puts his fist down on the
coffee table. “Mother, do you even
understand that that infernal device

is not only going to single-handedly
destroy my business but, worse than
that, send centuries of a vibrant
literary culture into what will
surely be an unceremonious and
rapid decline?” A.J. asks.
“You’re being dramatic,”
Amelia says. “Calm down.”
“Why should I calm down? I
do not like the present. I do not like
that thing and certainly not three of
that thing in my house. I would
rather you have bought my daughter
something less destructive like a
crack pipe.”
Maya giggles.
A.J.’s mother looks like she

might cry. “Well, I certainly didn’t
want to make anyone upset.”
“It’s fine,” Amelia says. “It’s a
lovely gift. We all love to read, and
I’m sure we’ll enjoy using them
very much. Besides, A.J. really is
being dramatic.”
“I’m sorry, A.J.,” his mother
says. “I didn’t know you’d have
such strong feelings about the
matter.”
“You could have asked!”
“Shut
up,
A.J.
Stop
apologizing, Mother Fikry,” Amelia
says. “It’s the perfect gift for a
family of readers. Lots of
bookstores are figuring out ways to

sell
e-books
along
with
conventional paper books. A.J. just
doesn’t want to — ”
A.J. interrupts. “You know
that’s bullshit, Amy!”
“You are being so rude,”
Amelia says. “You can’t put your
head in the sand and act like ereaders don’t exist. That’s no way
to deal with anything.”
“Do you smell smoke?” Maya
asks.
A second later, the fire alarm
goes off.
“Oh hell!” Amelia says. “The
brisket!” She runs into the kitchen,
and A.J. follows her. “I had my

phone set to go off, but it didn’t.”
“I put your phone on silent so
that it wouldn’t ruin Christmas!”
A.J. says.
“You what? Stop touching my
phone.”
“Why not use the timer that
came with the oven?”
“Because I DO NOT TRUST
IT! That oven is about one hundred
years old like everything else in this
house if you haven’t noticed.”
Amelia yells as she removes the
flaming brisket from the oven.
AS THE BRISKET is ruined,
Christmas dinner consists entirely
of side dishes.

“I like the sides the best,”
A.J.’s mother says.
“Me too,” Maya says.
“No substance,” A.J. mutters.
“They leave you hungry.” He has a
headache, which he does no favors
by drinking several glasses of red
wine.
“Would someone ask A.J. to
pass the wine?” Amelia says. “And
would someone tell A.J. he is
hogging the bottle?”
“Very mature,” A.J. says. He
pours her another glass.
“I honestly can’t wait to try it
out, Nana,” Maya whispers to her
stricken grandmother. “I’m going to

wait until I go to bed.” She darts
her eyes toward A.J. “You know.”
“I think that’s a very good
idea,” A.J.’s mother whispers back.
THAT NIGHT IN BED, A.J. is
still talking about the e-reader. “Do
you know the real problem with that
contraption?”
“I suppose you are about to
tell me,” Amelia says without
looking up from her paper book.
“Everyone thinks they have
good taste, but most people do not
have good taste. In fact, I’d argue
that most people have terrible taste.
When left to their own devices — 
literally their own devices — they

read crap and they don’t know the
difference.”
“Do you know what the good
thing about e-readers is?” Amelia
asks.
“No, Madame Bright Side,”
A.J. says. “And I don’t want to.”
“Well, for those of us with
husbands who are growing
farsighted, and I’m not going to
mention any names here. For those
of us with husbands who are
rapidly becoming middle-aged and
losing their vision. For those of us
burdened by pathetic half men for
spouses — ”
“Get to it, Amy!”

“An e-reader allows these
cursed creatures to enlarge the text
as much as they’d like.”
A.J. says nothing.
Amelia sets down her book to
smile smugly at her husband, but
when she looks over the man is
frozen. A.J. is having one of his
episodes. The episodes trouble
Amelia, though she reminds herself
not to be worried.
A minute and a half later, A.J.
comes to. “I’ve always been a bit
farsighted,” he says. “It’s not about
being middle-aged.”
She wipes the spittle from the
corners of his mouth with a

Kleenex.
“Christ, did I just black out?”
A.J. asks.
“You did.”
He grabs the tissue from
Amelia. He is not the type of man
who likes being tended to in this
way. “How long?”
“About ninety seconds, I’d
guess.” Amelia pauses. “Is that long
or average?”
“Maybe a bit long but
basically average.”
“Do you think you should go in
for a checkup?”
“No,” A.J. says. “You know
I’ve had these since I was a chive.”

“A chive?” she asks.
“A child. What did I say?”
A.J. gets out of bed and heads to the
bathroom, and Amelia follows him.
“Please, Amy. A little space.”
“I don’t want to give you
space,” she says.
“Fine.”
“I want you to go to the doctor.
That’s three of these since
Thanksgiving.”
A.J. shakes his head. “My
health insurance is crap, Amy
darling. And Dr. Rosen will say it’s
the same thing I’ve had for years
anyway. I’ll go see the doctor in
March for my annual like I always

do.”
Amelia
goes
into
the
bathroom. “Maybe Dr. Rosen can
give you a new medication?” She
squeezes between him and the
bathroom mirror, resting her
generous bum on the new doublesink counter that they installed last
month. “You are very important,
A.J.”
“I’m
not
exactly
the
president,” he retorts.
“You are the father of Maya.
And the love of my life. And a
purveyor of culture to this
community.”
A.J. rolls his eyes, then he

kisses Amelia the bright-sider on
the mouth.
CHRISTMAS AND NEW Year’s
are over; his mother is happily
returned to Arizona; Maya is back
to school and Amelia to work. The
real gift of the holiday season, A.J.
thinks, is that it ends. He likes the
routine. He likes making breakfast
in the morning. He likes running to
work.
He puts on his running clothes,
does a few halfhearted stretches,
throws a headband over his ears,
straps on his backpack, and
prepares to run to the store. Now
that he no longer lives above the

store, his route takes him in the
opposite direction of the one he
used to take when Nic was alive,
when Maya was a baby, in the first
years of his marriage to Amelia.
He runs past Ismay’s house,
which she once shared with Daniel
and now shares improbably with
Lambiase. He runs past the spot
where Daniel died, too. He runs
past the old dance studio. What was
the dance teacher’s name? He
knows she moved to California not
too long ago, and the dance studio
is empty. He wonders who will
teach the little girls of Alice Island
to dance? He runs past Maya’s

elementary school and past her
junior high and past her high school.
High school. She has a boyfriend.
The Furness boy is a writer. He
hears them arguing all the time. He
takes a shortcut through a field, and
is almost through it to Captain
Wiggins Street when he blacks out.
It is twenty-two degrees out,
and when he wakes his hand is blue
where it had rested on the ice.
He stands and warms his
hands on his jacket. He has never
passed out in the middle of a run
before.
“Madame Olenska,” he says.
DR. ROSEN GIVES him a full

examination. A.J. is in good health
for his age, but there’s something
strange about his eyes that gives the
doctor pause.
“Have you had any other
problems?” she asks.
“Well . . . Perhaps it’s just
growing older, but lately I seem to
have a verbal glitch every now and
again.”
“Glitch?” she says.
“I catch myself. It’s not that
bad. But I occasionally switch a
word with another word. Child for
chive, for example. Or last week I
called The Grapes of Wrath “The
Grapefruit Rag.” Obviously, this

poses a problem in my line of work.
I felt quite convinced that I was
saying the right thing. My wife
thought there might be an antiseizure
medication that could help?”
“Aphasia,” she says. “I don’t
like the sound of that.” Given A.J.’s
history of seizures, the doctor
decides to send him to a brain
specialist in Boston.
“How’s Molly doing?” A.J.
asks by way of changing the subject.
The surly salesgirl hasn’t worked
for him for six or seven years now.
“She’s just been accepted to . .
.” And the doctor names a writing
program, but A.J. isn’t paying

attention. He is thinking about his
brain. It strikes him that it is odd to
have to use the thing that may not be
working to consider the thing that
isn’t working. “. . . thinks she’s
going to write the Great American
Novel. I suppose I have you and
Nicole to blame,” the doctor says.
“Full responsibility,” A.J.
says.
GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME.

“Would you mind spelling that
for me?” A.J. asks. He has not
brought anyone to this appointment
with him. He has not wanted anyone
to know until he was certain. “I’d
like to Google it later.”

The cancer is so rare that the
oncologist
at
Massachusetts
General Hospital has never seen a
case other than in a scholarly
publication and once on the
television show Grey’s Anatomy.
“What happened to the case in
the publication?” A.J. asks.
“Death. Two years,” the
oncologist says.
“Two good years?”
“One pretty good year, I’d
say.”
A.J. goes for the second
opinion. “And on the TV show?”
The oncologist laughs, a noisy
chain saw of a laugh designed to be

the loudest sound in the room. See,
cancer is hilarious. “I don’t think
we should be making prognoses
based on nighttime soap operas,
Mr. Fikry.”
“What happened?”
“I believe the patient had the
surgery, lived for an episode or
two, thought he was in the clear,
proposed to his doctor girlfriend,
had a heart attack that was,
apparently, unrelated to the brain
cancer, and died the next episode.”
“Oh.”
“My
sister
writes
for
television, and I believe television
writers call this a three-episode

arc.”
“So I should expect to live
somewhere between three episodes
and two years.”
The oncologist chain saw
laughs again. “Good. A sense of
humor is key. I should say that
estimate sounds about right.” The
oncologist wants to schedule
surgery immediately.
“Immediately?”
“Your symptoms were masked
by your seizures, Mr. Fikry. And the
scans show that this tumor is quite
far advanced. I wouldn’t wait if I
were you.”
The surgery will cost nearly as

much as the down payment on their
house. It is unclear how much A.J.’s
meager
small-businessperson
insurance will cover. “If I have the
surgery, how much time does it buy
me?” A.J. asks.
“Depends on how much we’re
able to get out. Ten years, if we
manage clean margins. Two years,
maybe, if not. The kind of tumor you
have has the annoying tendency to
grow back.”
“And if you’re successful
removing the thing, am I left a
vegetable?”
“We don’t like to use terms
like vegetable, Mr. Fikry. But it’s

in your left frontal lobe. You’ll
likely experience the occasional
verbal deficit. Increased aphasia, et
cetera. But we won’t take out so
much that you aren’t left mostly
yourself. Of course, if left
untreated, the tumor will grow until
the language center of your brain is
pretty much gone. Whether we treat
or not, this will, in all likelihood,
happen eventually anyway.”
Weirdly, A.J. thinks of Proust.
Though he pretends to have read the
whole thing, A.J. has only ever read
the first volume of In Search of
Lost Time. It had been a struggle to
read that much, and now what he

thinks is, At least I will never have
to read the rest. “I have to discuss
this with my wife and my daughter,”
he says.
“Yes,
of
course,”
the
oncologist says, “but don’t delay
too long.”
ON THE TRAIN then the ferry
back to Alice, he thinks about
Maya’s college and Amelia’s
ability to pay the mortgage on the
house they bought less than a year
ago. By the time he is walking
down Captain Wiggins Street, he
decides that he cannot undertake
such a surgery if it means leaving
his nearest and dearest broke.

A.J. does not yet want to face
his family at home so he calls
Lambiase, and the two of them meet
at the bar.
“Tell me a good cop story,”
A.J. says.
“Like a story about a good cop
or a story that is interesting
involving police officers?”
“Either one. It’s up to you. I
want to hear something amusing that
will distract me from my
problems.”
“What problems do you have?
Perfect wife. Perfect kid. Good
business.”
“I’ll tell you after.”

Lambiase nods. “Okay. Let me
think. Maybe fifteen years ago,
there was this kid, goes to
Alicetown. He hasn’t been to
school for a month. Every day, he
tells his parents he’ll go and every
day, he doesn’t show up. Even if
they leave him there, he sneaks out
and goes somewhere else.”
“Where’s he going?”
“Right. The parents think he
must be in some serious trouble.
He’s a tough kid, hangs with a tough
crowd. They all get bad grades and
wear low pants. His parents run a
food stand at the beach, so there
isn’t much money. Anyhow, the

parents are at their wit’s end, so I
decide to follow the kid the whole
day. The kid goes to school, and
then between period one and two,
he just leaves. I’m trailing behind
him, and finally we get to a building
I’ve never been into before. I’m on
Main and Parker. You know where
I am?”
“That’s the library.”
“Bingo. You know I never
read much back then. So I follow
him up the stairs and into a library
carrel in the back and I’m thinking,
he’s probably going to do drugs or
something there. Perfect place,
right? Isolated. But you know what

he’s got?”
“Books, I’d imagine. That’s
the obvious thing, right?”
“He’s got one thick book. He’s
in the middle of Infinite Jest. You
ever heard of it?”
“Now you’re making this up.”
“The boy is reading Infinite
Jest. He says he can’t do it at home
because he has five siblings to
babysit and he can’t do it at school
because his buddies will make fun
of him. So he skips school to go
read in peace. The book takes a lot
of concentration. ‘Listen, hombre,’
he says, ‘there’s nothing for me at
school. Everything’s in this book.’ ”

“I take it, he’s Latino, by your
use of the word hombre. A lot of
Hispanic people on Alice Island?”
“A few.”
“So what do you do?”
“I haul his ass back to school.
The principal asks me how the kid
should be punished. I ask the kid
how long he thinks it’ll take him to
finish the book. He says, ’About
two weeks.’ And so I recommend
they give him a two-week
suspension for delinquency.”
“You’re definitely making this
up,” A.J. says. “Admit it. The
troubled youth was not skipping
school to read Infinite Jest.”

“He was, A.J. I swear to
God.” But then Lambiase bursts out
laughing. “You seemed depressed. I
wanted to tell you a story with a
little uplift.”
“Thanks. Thanks very much.”
A.J. orders another beer.
“What did you want to tell
me?”
“It’s funny that you should
mention Infinite Jest. Why did you
choose that particular title, by the
way?” A.J. says.
“I always see it in the store. It
takes up a lot of space on the shelf.”
A.J. nods. “I once had this
huge argument with a friend of mine

about it. He loved it. I hated it. But
the funniest thing about this dispute,
the thing I will confess to you now
is . . .”
“Yes?”
“That I never finished reading
it.” A.J. laughs. “That and Proust
can both go on my list of unfinished
works, thank God. My brain is
broken, by the way.” He takes out
the slip of paper and reads,
“Glioblastoma multiforme. It turns
you into a vegetable and then you
die. But at least it’s quick.”
Lambiase sets down his beer.
“There must be a surgery or
something,” he says.

“There is, but it costs a billion
dollars. And it only delays things
anyway. I won’t leave Amy and
Maya broke just to prolong my life
by a couple of months.”
Lambiase finishes his beer. He
signals the bartender for another
one. “I think you should let them
decide for themselves,” Lambiase
says.
“They’ll be sentimental,” A.J.
says.
“Let them be.”
“The right thing for me to do is
blow my stupid brains out, I’d say.”
Lambiase shakes his head.
“You’d do that to Maya?”

“How is it better for her to
have a brain-dead father and no
money for college?”
THAT NIGHT IN bed, after the
lights are off, Lambiase pulls Ismay
close to him. “I love you,” he tells
her. “And I want you to know that I
don’t judge you for anything you
might have done in the past.”
“Okay,” Ismay says. “I’m half
asleep and I don’t know what
you’re talking about.”
“I know about the bag in the
closet,” Lambiase whispers. “I
know that the book’s in there. I
don’t know how it got there and I
don’t need to know either. But it’s

only right that it be returned to its
rightful owner.”
After a long pause, Ismay says,
“The book’s ruined.”
“But
even a
damaged
Tamerlane might still be worth
something,” Lambiase says. “I
searched the Christie’s website and
the last copy on the market sold for
five hundred sixty thousand dollars.
So I figure maybe a damaged one is
worth fifty thousand or something.
And A.J. and Amy need the money.”
“Why do they need the
money?”
He tells her about A.J.’s
cancer, and Ismay covers her face

with her hands.
“The way I see it,” Lambiase
says, “we wipe the book down of
fingerprints, put it in an envelope,
and return it. No one has to know
where or who it came from.”
Ismay turns on the bedside
lamp. “How long have you known
about this?”
“Since the first night I spent at
your house.”
“And you didn’t care? Why
didn’t you turn me in?” Ismay’s
eyes are sharp.
“Because it wasn’t my
business, Izzie. I wasn’t invited in
your home as an officer of the law.

And I didn’t have a right to be
looking through your stuff. And I
figured there must be a story.
You’re a good woman, Ismay, and
you haven’t had it easy.”
Ismay sits up. Her hands are
shaking. She walks over to the
closet and pulls down the bag. “I
want you to know what happened,”
she says.
“I don’t need to,” Lambiase
says.
“Please, I want to tell you.
And don’t interrupt. If you interrupt
me, I won’t be able to get it all
out.”
“Okay, Izzie,” he says.

“The first time Marian
Wallace came to see me, I was five
months pregnant. She had Maya
with her, and the baby was about
two. Marian Wallace was very
young, very pretty, very tall with
tired, golden-brown eyes. She said,
‘Maya is Daniel’s daughter.’ And I
said — and I’m not proud of this
 — ‘How do I know you aren’t
lying?’ I could see perfectly well
that she wasn’t lying. I knew my
husband after all. I knew his type.
He had cheated on me from the day
we were married and probably
before that, too. But I loved his
books or at least that first one. And

I felt like somewhere down deep
inside him the person who wrote it
must be there. That you couldn’t
write such beautiful things and have
such an ugly heart. But that is the
truth. He was a beautiful writer and
a terrible person.
“I can’t blame Daniel for all of
this, though. I can’t blame him for
my part in it. I screamed at Marian
Wallace. She was twenty-two, but
she looked like a kid. ‘Do you think
you’re the first slut to show up here,
claiming to have had Daniel’s
baby?’
“She
apologized,
kept
apologizing. She said, ‘The baby

doesn’t have to be in Daniel
Parish’s life’ — she kept calling him
by his first and last name. She was
a fan, you see. She respected him.
‘The baby doesn’t have to be in
Daniel Parish’s life. We won’t
bother you ever again, I swear to
God. We just need a little money to
get started. To move on. He said he
would help, and now I can’t find
him anywhere.’ This made sense to
me. Daniel was always traveling a
lot — visiting writer at a school in
Switzerland, trips to Los Angeles
that never resulted in anything.
“ ‘Okay,’ I said. ‘I’ll try to get
in touch with him and see what I

can do. If he acknowledges that
your story is true — ’ But I already
knew that it was, Lambiase! ‘If he
acknowledges that your story is
true, maybe we can do something.’
The girl wanted to know how she
could best contact me. I told her I’d
be in touch.
“I talked to Daniel that night
on the phone. It was a good talk,
and I didn’t bring up Marian
Wallace. He was solicitous of me,
started making plans for our own
baby’s arrival. ‘Ismay,’ he said,
‘once the baby’s here, I’m going to
be a changed man.’ I had heard that
before. ‘No, I’m serious,’ he

insisted, ‘I’m definitely going to
travel less. I’m going to stay at
home, write more, take care of you
and the potato.’ He was always a
good talker and I wanted to believe
that this was the night everything
was going to change in my
marriage. I decided right then and
there that I would take care of the
problem with Marian Wallace. I
would find a way to buy her off.
“People in this town have
always thought my family had more
money than we actually did. Nic
and I did have small trust funds, but
it wasn’t a ton. She used hers to buy
the store, and I used mine to buy

this house. What was left over from
my side, my husband spent quickly.
His first book sold well, but the
ones after less so, and he always
had champagne tastes and an
inconsistent income. I’m only a
schoolteacher. Daniel and I always
looked rich, but we were poor.
“Down the hill, my sister had
been dead for over a year, and her
husband was steadily drinking
himself to death. Out of obligation
to her, I would check on A.J. some
nights. I’d let myself in, wipe the
vomit off his face, and drag him to
bed. One night, I go in. A.J. is
passed out as usual. And

Tamerlane is sitting on the table. I
should say here that I was with him
the day he found Tamerlane. Not
that he ever offered to split the
money with me, which probably
would have been the decent thing to
do. Cheap bastard never would
have been at that estate sale if not
for me. So I put A.J. to bed, and I
go out to the living room to clean up
the mess, and I wipe everything
down, and the last thing I do,
without even really thinking about
it, is I slip the book into my bag.
“The next day, everyone is
looking for Tamerlane, but I’m out
of town. I’ve gone into Cambridge

for the day. I go to Marian
Wallace’s dorm room, and I throw
the book on her bed. I tell her,
‘Look, you can sell this. It’s worth a
lot of money.’ And she looks at the
book dubiously, and she says, ‘Is it
hot?’ And I say, ‘No, it belongs to
Daniel, and he wants you to have it,
but you can never say where it came
from. Bring it to an auction house or
a rare-books dealer. Claim you
found it in a used-books bin
somewhere.’ I don’t hear from
Marian Wallace again for a while,
and I think maybe that’s the end of
it.” Ismay’s voice trails off.
“But it isn’t?” Lambiase asks.

“No. She shows up at the
house with Maya and the book just
before Christmas. She says she’s
gone to every auction house and
dealer in the Boston area, and none
of them want to deal with the book
because it doesn’t have a
provenance, and the cops have been
calling about a stolen copy of
Tamerlane. She takes the book from
her bag and hands it to me. I throw
it back at her. ‘What am I going to
do with this?’ Marian Wallace just
shakes her head. The book lands on
the floor, and the little girl picks it
up and starts flipping through it, but
no one’s paying any attention to her.

Marian Wallace’s huge amber eyes
fill with tears, and she says, ‘Have
you read “Tamerlane,” Mrs.
Parish? It’s so sad.’ I shake my
head. ‘It’s a poem about this
Turkish conqueror who trades the
love of his life, this poor peasant
girl, for power.’ I roll my eyes at
her, and I say, ‘Is that what you
think is happening here? Do you
fancy yourself some poor peasant
girl, and I’m the mean wife who is
keeping you from the love of your
life?’
“ ‘No,’ she says. At this point,
the baby is crying. Marian says that
the worst of it is that she knew what

she was doing. Daniel had come to
her college for a reading. She had
loved that book, and when she slept
with him she had read his author
biography a million times and she
knew perfectly well that he was
married. ‘I’ve made so many
mistakes,’ she says. ‘I can’t help
you,’ I say. She shakes her head and
picks up the baby. ‘We’ll be out of
your way now,’ she says. ‘Merry
Christmas.’
“And they leave. I’m pretty
shaken up, so I go into the kitchen to
make myself some tea. When I get
back out to the living room, I notice
that the little girl has left her

backpack and Tamerlane is on the
floor next to it. I pick up the book.
I’m thinking I’ll just slip into A.J.’s
apartment tomorrow or the next
night and return it. That’s when I
notice it is covered in crayon
drawings. The little girl has ruined
it! I zip it into the bag and put it in
my closet. I don’t take pains to hide
it very much. I think maybe Daniel
will find it and ask me about it, but
he never does. He never cares. That
night, A.J. calls me about the proper
things to feed a baby. He’s got
Maya at his apartment, and I agree
to go over.”
“The day after that, Marian

Wallace washes up by the
lighthouse,” Lambiase says.
“Yes, I wait to see if Daniel
will say anything, to see if he will
recognize the girl and claim the
baby, but he doesn’t. And I, coward
that I am, never bring it up.”
Lambiase takes her in his
arms. “None of this matters,” he
says after a while. “If there was a
crime — ”
“ The r e was a crime,” she
insists.
“If there was a crime,” he
repeats, “everyone who knows
about any of it is dead.”
“Except Maya.”

“Maya’s life has turned out
beautifully,” Lambiase says.
Ismay shakes her head. “It has,
hasn’t it?”
“The way I see it,” Lambiase
says, “you saved A. J. Fikry’s life
when you stole that manuscript.
That’s the way I see it.”
“What kind of cop are you?”
Ismay asks.
“The old kind,” he says.
THE NEXT NIGHT, like every
third Wednesday of every month for
the last ten years, is Chief’s Choice
at Island Books. At first, the police
officers felt obligated to join, but
the group has grown in genuine

popularity over the years. Now it’s
the largest book meetup that Island
has. Police officers still make up
the bulk of the membership, but
their wives and even some of their
children, when they get old enough,
attend. Years ago, Lambiase had
had to institute a “leave your
weapons” policy after a young cop
had pulled a gun on another cop
during a particularly heated
discussion of The House of Sand
and Fog. (Lambiase would later
reflect to A.J. that the selection had
been a mistake. “Had an interesting
cop character but too much moral
ambiguity in that one. I’m going to

stick to easier genre stuff from now
on.”) Other than this incident, the
group has been free of violence.
Aside from the content of the books,
of course.
As is his tradition, Lambiase
arrives at the store early to set up
for Chief’s Choice and talk to A.J.
“I saw this resting on the door,”
Lambiase says when he comes
inside. He hands a padded manila
envelope with A.J.’s name on it to
his friend.
“Probably another galley,”
A.J. says.
“Don’t say that,” Lambiase
jokes. “Could be the next big thing

in there.”
“Yeah, I’m sure. It’s probably
the Great American Novel. I’ll add
it to my stack: Things to Read
before My Brain Stops Working.”
A.J. sets the package on the
countertop, and Lambiase watches
it. “You never know,” Lambiase
says.
“I’m like a girl who has been
on the dating scene too long. I’ve
had too many disappointments, too
many promises of ‘the one,’ and
they never are. As a cop, don’t you
get that way?”
“What way?”
“Cynical, I guess,” A.J. says.

“Don’t you ever get to the point
where you expect the worst from
people all the time?”
Lambiase shakes his head.
“No. I see good people just as much
as I see bad ones.”
“Yeah, name me some.”
“People like you, my friend.”
Lambiase clears his throat, and A.J.
can think of no reply. “What’s good
in crime that I haven’t read? I need
some new picks for Chief’s
Choice.”
A.J. walks over to the crime
section. He looks across the spines,
which are, for the most part, black
and red with all capitalized fonts in

silvers and whites. An occasional
burst of fluorescence breaks up the
monotony. A.J. thinks how similar
everything in the crime genre looks.
Why is any one book different from
any other book? They are different,
A.J. decides, because they are. We
have to look inside many. We have
to believe. We agree to be
disappointed sometimes so that we
can be exhilarated every now and
again.
He selects one and holds it out
to his friend. “Maybe this?”

Chapter 12. What We Talk about When We Talk about Love
1980 / Raymond Carver
Two couples get increasingly
drunk; discuss what is and what is not
love.
A question I’ve thought about a
great deal is why it is so much easier
to write about the things we
dislike/hate/ acknowledge to be flawed
than the things we love.* This is my
favorite short story, Maya, and yet I
cannot begin to tell you why.
(You and Amelia are my favorite
people, too.)
 — A.J.F.
*This accounts for much of the
Internet, of course.

Lot 2200. A last-minute
addition to the afternoon’s auction
and a rare opportunity for the
vintage
books
connoisseur.
Tamerlane and Other Poems by
Edgar Allan Poe. Written when Poe
was eighteen and attributed to ‘A
Bostonian.’ Only fifty printed at the
time. Tamerlane will be the crown
jewel in any serious rare-books
collection. This copy shows some
wear at the spine and is marked in
crayon on the cover. The damage
should not in any way spoil the
beauty or diminish the rarity of this
object, which cannot be overstated.
Let the bidding begin at twenty

thousand dollars.”
The book sells for seventy-two
thousand
dollars,
modestly
exceeding the reserve. After fees
and taxes, this is enough money to
cover A.J.’s copay on the surgery
and the first round of radiation.
Even after he receives the
check from Christie’s, A.J. has
doubts about whether to go through
with treatment. He still suspects that
the money would be better spent on
Maya’s college education. “No,”
Maya says. “I’m smart. I’ll get a
scholarship. I’ll write the world’s
saddest admissions essay about
how I was an orphan abandoned in

a bookstore by my single mother
and how my adopted dad got the
rarest form of brain cancer, but look
at me now. An upstanding member
of society. People will eat it up,
Dad.”
“That is awfully crass of you,
my little nerd.” A.J. laughs at the
monster he has created.
“I have money, too,” the wife
insists. Bottom line is, the women
in A.J.’s life want him to live, and
so he books the surgery.
“SITTING HERE, I find myself
thinking that The Late Bloomer
really was a bunch of hokum,”
Amelia says bitterly. She stands up

and walks over to the window. “Do
you want the blinds raised or
lowered? Raised, we get a spot of
natural light and the lovely view of
the children’s hospital across the
way. Lowered, you can enjoy my
deathly pallor under the fluorescent
lights. It’s up to you.”
“Raised,” A.J. says. “I want to
remember you at your best.”
“Do you remember when
Friedman writes how you can’t
truly describe a hospital room?
How a hospital room when the one
you love is in it is too painful to be
described or some such crap? How
did we ever think that was poetic?

I’m disgusted with us. At this stage
in my life, I’m with all the people
that never wanted to read that book
in the first place. I’m with the cover
designer who put the flowers and
the feet on the front. Because you
know what? You totally can
describe a hospital room. It’s gray.
The art is the worst art you’ve ever
seen. Like stuff that got rejected by
the Holiday Inn. Everything smells
like someone is trying to cover up
the smell of piss.”
“You
loved The
Late
Bloomer, Amy.”
She has still never told him
about Leon Friedman. “But I didn’t

want to be in some stupid play
version of it when I was in my
forties.”
“Do you think I should really
have this surgery?”
Amelia rolls her eyes. “Yes, I
do. Number one, it’s happening in
twenty minutes, so we probably
couldn’t get our money back
anyway. And number two, you’ve
had your head shaved, and you look
like a terrorist. I don’t see what the
point is in turning back now,”
Amelia says.
“Is it really worth the money
for two more years that are likely to
be crappy?” he asks Amelia.

“It is,” she says, taking his
hand.
“I remember a woman who
told me about the importance of
shared sensibility. I remember a
woman who said she broke up with
a bona fide American Hero because
they didn’t have good conversation.
That could happen to us, you
know,” A.J. says.
“That is an entirely different
situation,” Amelia insists. A second
later, she yells, “FUCK!” A.J.
thinks something must be seriously
wrong because Amelia never
curses.
“What is it?”

“Well, the thing is, I rather like
your brain.”
He laughs at her, and she
weeps a little.
“Oh, enough with the tears. I
don’t want your pity.”
“I’m not crying for you. I’m
crying for me. Do you know how
long it took me to find you? Do you
know how many awful dates I’ve
been on? I can’t” — she is breathless
now — “I can’t join Match.com
again. I just can’t.”
“Big Bird — always looking
ahead.”
“Big Bird. What the . . . ? You
can’t introduce a nickname at this

point in our relationship!”
“You’ll meet someone. I did.”
“Fuck you. I like you. I’m used
to you. You are the one, you
asshole. I can’t meet someone
new.”
He kisses her and then she
reaches under his hospital gown
between his legs and squeezes. “I
love having sex with you,” she says.
“If you’re a vegetable when this is
done, can I still have sex with
you?” she asks.
“Sure,” A.J. says.
“And you won’t think less of
me?”
“No.” He pauses. “I’m not

sure I’m comfortable with the turn
this conversation has taken,” he
says.
“You knew me four years
before you asked me out.”
“True.”
“You were so mean to me the
day we met.”
“Also true.”
“I’m so screwed up. How will
I ever find someone else?”
“You
seem
remarkably
unconcerned about my brain.”
“Your brain’s toast. We both
know that. But what about me?”
“Poor Amy.”
“Yes, before I was a

bookseller’s wife. That was
pitiable enough. Soon I’ll be the
bookseller’s widow.”
She kisses him on every place
of his malfunctioning head. “I liked
this brain. I like this brain! It is a
very good brain.”
“Me too,” he says.
The attendant comes to wheel
him away. “I love you,” she says
with a resigned shrug. “I want to
leave you with something cleverer
than that, but it’s all I know.”
WHEN HE WAKES, he finds the
words are more or less there. It
takes a while to find some of them,
but they are there.

Blood.
Painkiller.
Vomit.
Bucket.
Hemorrhoids.
Diarrhea.
Water.
Blisters.
Diaper.
Ice.
After surgery, he is brought to
an isolated wing of the hospital for
a monthlong course of radiation.
His immune system is so
compromised from the radiation
that he isn’t allowed any visitors. It
is the loneliest he has ever been and

that includes the period after Nic’s
death. He wishes he could get
drunk, but his irradiated stomach
couldn’t take it. This is what life
had been like before Maya and
before Amelia. A man is not his
own island. Or at least a man is not
optimally his own island.
When he isn’t throwing up or
restlessly half sleeping, he digs out
the e-reader his mother had given
him last Christmas. (The nurses
deem the e-reader to be more
sanitary than a paper book. “They
should put that on the box,” A.J.
quips.) He finds that he can’t stay
awake to read an entire novel. Short

stories are better. He has always
preferred short stories anyway. As
he is reading, he finds that he wants
to make a new list of short stories
for Maya. She is going to be a
writer, he knows. He is not a
writer, but he has thoughts about the
profession, and he wants to tell her
those
things. Maya, novels
certainly have their charms, but
the most elegant creation in the
prose universe is a short story.
Master the short story and you’ll
have mastered the world, he thinks
just before he drifts off to sleep. I
should write this down, he thinks.
He reaches for a pen, but there isn’t

one anywhere near the toilet bowl
he is resting against.
At the end of the radiation
treatment, the oncologist finds that
his tumor has neither shrunk nor
grown. He gives A.J. a year. “Your
speech and everything else will
likely deteriorate,” he says in a
voice that strikes A.J. as
incongruously chipper. No matter,
A.J. is glad to be going home.

Chapter 13. The Bookseller
1986 / Roald Dahl
Bonbon about a bookseller with an
unusual way of extorting money from
customers. In terms of characters, it is
Dahl’s
usual
collection
of
opportunistic grotesques. In terms of
plot, the twist is a latecomer and not
enough to redeem the story’s flaws.
“The Bookseller” really shouldn’t be
on this list — it is not an exceptional
Dahl offering in any way. Certainly no
“Lamb to the Slaughter” — and yet here
it is. How to account for its presence
when I know it is only average? The
answer is this: Your dad relates to the
characters. It has meaning to me. And
the longer I do this (bookselling, yes,
of course, but also living if that isn’t
too awfully sentimental), the more I
believe that this is what the point of it

all is. To connect, my dear little nerd.
Only connect.
 — A.J.F.

It is so simple, he thinks.
Maya, he wants to say, I have
figured it all out.
But his brain won’t let him.
The words you can’t find, you
borrow.
We read to know we’re not
alone. We read because we are
alone. We read and we are not
alone. We are not alone.
My life is in these books, he
wants to tell her. Read these and
know my heart.
We are not quite novels.
The analogy he is looking for
is almost there.
We are not quite short

stories. At this point, his life is
seeming closest to that.
In the end, we are collected
works.
He has read enough to know
there are no collections where each
story is perfect. Some hits. Some
misses. If you’re lucky, a standout.
And in the end, people only really
remember the standouts anyway,
and they don’t remember those for
very long.
No, not very long.
“Dad,” Maya says.
He tries to figure out what she
is saying. The lips and the sounds.
What can they mean?

Thankfully,
she
repeats,
“Dad.”
Yes, Dad. Dad is what I am.
Dad is what I became. The father
of Maya. Maya’s dad. Dad. What a
word. What a little big word. What
a word and what a world! He is
crying. His heart is too full, and no
words to release it. I know what
words do, he thinks. They let us
feel less.
“No, Dad. Please don’t. It’s
okay.”
She puts her arms around him.
Reading has become difficult.
If he tries very hard, he can still
make it through a short story.

Novels have become impossible.
He can write more easily than he
can speak. Not that writing is easy.
He writes a paragraph a day. A
paragraph for Maya. It isn’t much,
but it’s what he has left to give.
He wants to tell her something
very important.
“Does it hurt?” she asks.
No, he thinks. The brain has no
pain sensors and so it can’t hurt.
The loss of his mind has turned out
to be a curiously pain-free process.
He feels that it ought to hurt more.
“Are you afraid?” she asks.
Not of dying, he thinks, but a
little of this part I’m in. Every day,

there is less of me. Today I am
thoughts without words. Tomorrow
I will be a body without thoughts.
And so it goes. But Maya, you are
here right now and so I am glad to
be here. Even without books and
words. Even without my mind. How
the hell do you say this? How do
you even begin?
Maya is staring at him and
now she is crying, too.
“Maya,” he says. “There is
only one word that matters.” He
looks at her to see if he has been
understood. Her brow is furrowed.
He can tell that he hasn’t made
himself clear. Fuck. Most of what

he says is gibberish these days. If
he wants to be understood, it is best
to limit himself to one word replies.
But some things take longer than
one word to explain.
He will try again. He will
never stop trying. “Maya, we are
what we love. We are that we
love.”
Maya is shaking her head.
“Dad, I’m sorry. I don’t
understand.”
“We aren’t the things we
collect, acquire, read. We are, for
as long as we are here, only love.
The things we loved. The people
we loved. And these, I think these

really do live on.”
She is still shaking her head. “I
can’t understand you, Dad. I wish I
could. Do you want me to get Amy?
Or maybe you could try to type it?”
He is sweating. Conversing
isn’t fun anymore. It used to be so
easy. All right, he thinks. If it’s
gotta be one word, it’s gotta be
one word.
“Love?” he asks. He prays it
has come out right.
She furrows her brow and
tries to read his face. “Gloves?”
she asks. “Are your hands cold,
Dad?”
He nods, and she takes his

hands in hers. His hands had been
cold, and now they are warm, and
he decides that he’s gotten close
enough for today. Tomorrow,
maybe, he will find the words.
AT THE BOOKSELLER’S funeral,
the question on everyone’s mind is
what will become of Island Books.
People are attached to their
bookstores, more attached than A. J.
Fikry ever would have ever
guessed. It matters who placed A
Wrinkle in Time in your twelveyear-old daughter’s nail-bitten
fingers or who sold you that Let’s
Go travel guide to Hawaii or who
insisted that your aunt with the very

particular tastes would surely adore
Cloud Atlas. Furthermore, they like
Island Books. And even though they
aren’t always perfectly faithful,
even though they buy e-books
sometimes and shop online, they
like what it says about their town
that Island Books is right in the
center of the main strip, that it’s the
second or third place you come to
after you get off the ferry.
At the funeral, they approach
Maya and Amelia, respectfully, of
course, and whisper, “A.J. can’t
ever be replaced but will you find
someone else to run the store?”
Amelia doesn’t know what to

do. She loves Alice. She loves
Island Books. She has no
experience running a bookstore. She
has always worked on the publisher
side of things and she needs her
steady paycheck and health
insurance even more now that she is
responsible
for
Maya.
She
considers leaving the store open
and letting someone else run it
during the week, but the plan isn’t
tenable. The commute is too great,
and what it really makes sense to do
is move off the island altogether.
After a week of heartsickness and
bad sleep and intellectual pacing,
she makes the decision to close the

store. The store — the building the
store is housed in and the land it
sits on, at least — is worth a lot of
money. (Nic and A.J. had bought it
outright all those years ago.)
Amelia loves Island Books, but she
can’t make it work. For a month or
so, she makes attempts at selling the
store, but no buyers come forward.
She puts the building on the market.
Island Books will close at the end
of the summer.
“End of an era,” Lambiase
says to Ismay over eggs at the local
diner. He’s brokenhearted over the
news, but he’s planning to leave
Alice soon anyway. He will have

twenty-five years on the police
force next spring, and he’s got a fair
amount of money saved up. He
imagines himself buying a boat and
living in the Florida Keys, like a
retired cop character in an Elmore
Leonard novel. He’s been trying to
convince Ismay to come with him,
and he thinks he’s starting to wear
her down. Lately she’s been finding
fewer and fewer reasons to object,
although she is one of those odd
New England creatures who
actually like the winter.
“I hoped they’d find someone
else to run the store. But the truth is,
Island Books wouldn’t be the same

without A.J., Maya, and Amelia
anyway,”
Lambiase
says.
“Wouldn’t have the same heart.”
“True,” Ismay says. “It’s
gross, though. They’ll probably turn
it into a Forever 21.”
“What’s a Forever 21?”
Ismay laughs at him. “How do
you not know this? Wasn’t it ever
referenced in one of those YA
novels you’re always reading?”
“Young-adult fiction isn’t like
that.”
“It’s a chain clothing store.
Actually, we should be so lucky.
They’ll probably turn it into a
bank.” She sips at her coffee. “Or a

drugstore.”
“Maybe a Jamba Juice?”
Lambiase says. “I love Jamba
Juice.”
Ismay starts to cry.
The waitress stops by the
table, and Lambiase indicates that
she should clear the plates. “I know
how you feel,” Lambiase says. “I
don’t like it either, Izzie. You know
something funny about me? I never
read much before I met A.J. and
started going to Island. As a kid, the
teachers thought I was a slow
reader, so I never got the knack for
it.”
“You tell a kid he doesn’t like

to read, and he’ll believe you,”
Ismay says.
“Mainly got C’s in English,
too. Once A.J. adopted Maya, I
wanted to have an excuse to go into
the store to check on them, so I kept
reading whatever he’d give me.
And then I started to like it.”
Ismay cries harder.
“Turns out I really like
bookstores. You know, I meet a lot
of people in my line of work. A lot
of folks pass through Alice Island,
especially in the summer. I’ve seen
movie people on vacation and I’ve
seen music people and newspeople,
too. There ain’t nobody in the

world like book people. It’s a
business
of
gentlemen
and
gentlewomen.”
“I wouldn’t go that far,” Ismay
says.
“I don’t know, Izzie. I’m
telling you. Bookstores attract the
right kind of folk. Good people like
A.J. and Amelia. And I like talking
about books with people who like
talking about books. I like paper. I
like how it feels, and I like the feel
of a book in my back pocket. I like
how a new book smells, too.”
Ismay kisses him. “You’re the
funniest sort of cop I ever met.”
“I worry about what Alice is

going to be like if there isn’t a
bookstore here,” Lambiase says as
he finishes his coffee.
“Me too.”
Lambiase leans across the
table and kisses her on the cheek.
“Hey, here’s a crazy thought. What
if, instead of going to Florida, you
and me took over the place?”
“In this economy, that is a
crazy thought,” Ismay says.
“Yeah,” he says. “Probably
so.” The waitress asks if they want
dessert. Ismay says she doesn’t
want anything, but Lambiase knows
she’ll always share a little of his.
He orders a slice of cherry pie, two

forks.
“But, you know, what if we
did?” Lambiase continues. “I’ve got
savings and a pretty good pension
about to come in, and so do you.
And A.J. said the summer people
always bought a lot of books.”
“The summer people have ereaders now,” Ismay counters.
“True,” Lambiase says. He
decides to let the subject drop.
They are halfway through their
pie when Ismay says, “We could
open a cafe, too. That would
probably help with the bottom
line.”
“Yeah, A.J. used to talk about

that sometimes.”
“And,” Ismay says, “we turn
the basement into a theater space.
That way, the author events don’t
have to be right in the middle of the
store. Maybe people could even
rent it as a theater or meeting space
sometimes, too.”
“Your theater background
would be great for that,” Lambiase
says.
“Are you sure you’re up to
this? We aren’t super young,” Ismay
says. “What about no winters? What
about Florida?”
“We’ll go there when we’re
old. We’re not old yet,” Lambiase

says after a pause. “I’ve lived in
Alice my whole life. It’s the only
place I’ve ever known. It’s a nice
place, and I intend to keep it that
way. A place ain’t a place without
a bookstore, Izzie.”
A FEW YEARS after she sells the
store to Ismay and Lambiase,
Amelia decides to leave Knightley
Press. Maya is graduating from high
school soon, and Amelia is tired of
traveling so much. She finds a
position as a book buyer for a large
general retailer out of Maine.
Before she leaves, as her
predecessor Harvey Rhodes had
done, Amelia writes up notes on all

her active accounts. She saves
Island Books for last.
“Island Books,” she reports.
“Owners: Ismay Parish (ex – school
teacher) and Nicholas Lambiase (ex
– police chief). Lambiase is an
exceptional hand seller, especially
of literary crime fiction and young
adult novels. Parish, who used to
run the high school drama club, can
be counted on to throw an A+
author event. The store has a cafe, a
stage, and an excellent online
presence. All this was built on the
solid foundation established by A.
J. Fikry, the original owner whose
tastes ran more toward the literary.

The store still carries a ton of
literary fiction, but the owners
won’t take what they can’t sell. I
love Island Books with all my
heart. I do not believe in God. I
have no religion. But this to me is
as close to a church as I have
known in this life. It is a holy place.
With bookstores like this, I feel
confident in saying that there will
be a book business for a very long
time.  — Amelia Loman”
Amelia
feels
a
bit
embarrassed about those last
several
sentences
and
cuts
everything after “the owners won’t
take what they can’t sell.”

WON’T take
what they can’t sell.” Jacob
Gardner reads his predecessor’s
notes one last time, then clicks off
his phone and disembarks the ferry
with long, purposeful strides.
Jacob, twenty-seven years old and
armed with a half-paid-off master’s
degree in nonfiction writing, is
ready. He can’t believe his luck in
landing this job. Sure, the pay could
be better, but he loves books, has
always loved books. He believes
that they saved his life. He even has
that famous C. S. Lewis quote
tattooed on his wrist. Imagine
getting to be one of those people
“. . . THE OWNERS

who actually gets paid to talk about
literature. He’d do this for free, not
that he wants his publisher to know
that. He needs the money. Living in
Boston isn’t cheap, and he’s only
doing this day job to support his
passion: his oral history of gay
vaudevillians. But this isn’t to take
away from the fact that Jacob
Gardner is nothing short of a
believer. He even walks like he has
a calling. He could be mistaken for
a missionary. In point of fact, he
was raised Mormon, but this is
another story.
Island is Jacob’s first sales
call, and he can’t wait to get there.

He can’t wait to tell them about all
the great books he’s carrying in his
Knightley Press tote bag. The bag
must weigh almost fifty pounds, but
Jacob works out and he isn’t even
feeling it. Knightley’s got a
remarkably strong list this year, and
he’s certain his job will be easy.
Readers are going to have no
choice but to love these titles. The
nice woman who hired him had
suggested he start with Island
Books. The owner there loves
literary crime fiction, eh? Well,
Jacob’s favorite from the list is a
debut about an Amish girl who
disappears while on Rumspringa,

and in Jacob’s opinion, it’s a mustread for all serious lovers of
literary crime fiction.
As Jacob passes over the
threshold of the purple Victorian,
the wind chimes play their familiar
song and a gruff, but not unfriendly,
voice calls, “Welcome.”
Jacob walks down the history
aisle and holds out his hand to the
middle-aged man on the ladder.
“Mr. Lambiase, have I got a book
for you!”

Acknowledgments
There aren’t unicorns, there is
no Alice Island, and A. J. Fikry’s
tastes are not always my own.
Lambiase and the first Ms.
Fikry speak variations on the
phrase, “A town isn’t a town
without a bookstore.” Surely, they
both must have read American
Gods by Neil Gaiman.
Kathy Pories edited this book

My dad, Richard Zevin, bought
me my first book with chapters,
Little House in the Big Woods, and
when I liked that one, made a happy
gift of the next thousand or so. On
her lunch hours from work, my
mom, AeRan Zevin, used to drive
me to the bookstore so I could get
my favorite authors on their first
day of release. My grandparents
Adele and Meyer Sussman gave me
books practically every time they
saw me. My eleventh-grade English
teacher, Judith Beiner, introduced
me to contemporary literary fiction
when I was at a particularly

impressionable age. Hans Canosa
has been my first and most patient
reader for the better part of two
decades. Janine O’Malley, Lauren
Wein, and Jonathan Burnham were
the editors on the seven books I
wrote before this one. In
combination, all these acts and
people might hold the formula for
growing a writer.
As a sales rep for Farrar
Straus Giroux, the gregarious Mark
Gates, who is no longer with us,
drove me around Chicagoland on
my 2007 book tour. I suspect I
began to conceive of this book back
then. Several years later, Vanessa

Cronin graciously answered my
questions about sales calls and the
timing of lists. Mistakes should be
considered my own, of course.
I would be remiss if I did not
acknowledge the many booksellers,
author escorts, librarians, teachers,
writers, book festival volunteers,
and sundry publishing folk who
have hosted and chatted with me in
the ten years since I sold my first
novel. These conversations are the
foundation on which Island Books
was built.
Finally, liberties were taken
with regard to the depiction of the
Green Animals Topiary Garden in

Portsmouth, Rhode Island. What is
true: the garden is not open in
winter, but in the summer, you will
indeed find a unicorn there.
