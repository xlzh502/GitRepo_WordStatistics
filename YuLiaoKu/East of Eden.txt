EAST OF EDEN
John Steinbeck was born in Salinas, California, in 1902. The town is a
few miles from the Pacific Coast and near the fertile Salinas Valley—an
area that was to be the background of much of his fiction. He studied
marine biology at Stanford University but left without taking a degree
and, after a series of laboring jobs, began to write. An attempt at a freelance lit-erary career in New York City failed, and he returned to
California, continuing to write in a lonely cottage. Popular success came
to him only in 1935 with Tor-tilla Flat. That book’s promise was
confirmed by suc-ceeding works—In Dubious Battle, Of Mice and Men,
and especially The Grapes of Wrath, a novel so powerful that it remains
among the archetypes of American culture. Often set in California,
Steinbeck’s later books include Cannery Row, The Wayward Bus, East of
Eden, The Short Reign of Pippin IV, and Travels with Charley. He died in
1968, having won a Nobel Prize in 1962. In announcing the award, the
Swedish Academy declared: “He had no mind to be an unoffending
comforter and entertainer. Instead, the topics he chose were serious and
denunciatory, for instance the bitter strikes on California’s fruit and
cotton plantations. ... His literary power steadily gained impetus. ... The
little masterpiece Of Mice and Men ... was followed by those
incomparable short stories which he collected together in the vol-ume
The Long Valley. The way had now been paved for the great work ... the
epic chronicle The Grapes of Wrath.”

PASCAL COVICI
Dear Pat,
You came upon me carving some kind of little figure out of wood and you said, “Why don’t you
make something for me?”
I asked you what you wanted, and you said, “A box.”
“What for?”
“To put things in.”
“What things?”
“Whatever you have,” you said.
Well, here’s your box. Nearly everything I have is in it, and it is not full. Pain and excitement are
in it, and feeling good or bad and evil thoughts and good thoughts—the pleasure of design and
some despair and the indescribable joy of creation.
And on top of these are all the gratitude and love I have for you.
And still the box is not full.
JOHN

Chapter 1
1
The Salinas Valley is in Northern California. It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of
mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey
Bay.
I remember my childhood names for grasses and secret flowers. I remember where a toad may
live and what time the birds awaken in the summer—and what trees and seasons smelled like—
how people looked and walked and smelled even. The memory of odors is very rich.
I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gay mountains full of
sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you wanted to climb into their warm foothills
almost as you want to climb into the lap of a beloved mother. They were beckoning mountains
with a brown grass love. The Santa Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the
valley from the open sea, and they were dark and brooding—unfriendly and dangerous. I always
found in myself a dread of west and a love of east. Where I ever got such an idea I cannot say,
unless it could be that the morning came over the peaks of the Gabilans and the night drifted back
from the ridges of the Santa Lucias. It may be that the birth and death of the day had some part in
my feeling about the two ranges of mountains.
From both sides of the valley little streams slipped out of the hill canyons and fell into the bed of
the Salinas River. In the winter of wet years the streams ran full-freshet, and they swelled the
river until some-times it raged and boiled, bank full, and then it was a destroyer. The river tore
the edges of the farm lands and washed whole acres down; it toppled barns and houses into itself,
to go floating and bobbing away. It trapped cows and pigs and sheep and drowned them in its
muddy brown water and carried them to the sea. Then when the late spring came, the river drew
in from its edges and the sand banks appeared. And in the summer the river didn’t run at all
above ground. Some pools would be left in the deep swirl places under a high bank. The tules and
grasses grew back, and wil-lows straightened up with the flood debris in their upper branches.
The Salinas was only a part-time river. The summer sun drove it underground. It was not a fine
river at all, but it was the only one we had and so we boasted about it—how dangerous it was in a
wet winter and how dry it was in a dry summer. You can boast about anything if it’s all you have.
Maybe the less you have, the more you are required to boast.
The floor of the Salinas Valley, between the ranges and below the foothills, is level because this
valley used to be the bottom of a hundred-mile inlet from the sea. The river mouth at Moss
Landing was centuries ago the entrance to this long inland water. Once, fifty miles down the
valley, my father bored a well. The drill came up first with topsoil and then with gravel and then
with white sea sand full of shells and even pieces of whale-bone. There were twenty feet of sand

and then black earth again, and even a piece of redwood, that imper-ishable wood that does not
rot. Before the inland sea the valley must have been a forest. And those things had happened right
under our feet. And it seemed to me sometimes at night that I could feel both the sea and the
redwood forest before it.
On the wide level acres of the valley the topsoil lay deep and fertile. It required only a rich winter
of rain to make it break forth in grass and flowers. The spring flowers in a wet year were
unbelievable. The whole valley floor, and the foothills too, would be carpeted with lupins and
poppies. Once a woman told me that colored flowers would seem more bright if you added a few
white flowers to give the colors definition. Every petal of blue lupin is edged with white, so that a
field of lurins is more blue than you can imagine. And mixed with these were splashes of
California poppies. These too are of a burning color—not orange, not gold, but if pure gold were
liquid and could raise a cream, that golden cream might be like the color of the poppies. When
their season was over the yellow mustard came up and grew to a great height. When my
grandfather came into the valley the mustard was so tall that a man on horseback showed only his
head above the yellow flowers. On the uplands the grass would be strewn with buttercups, with
hen-and-chickens, with black-centered yellow violets. And a little later in the season there would
be red and yellow stands of Indian paintbrush. These were the flowers of the open places exposed
to the sun.
Under the live oaks, shaded and dusky, the maiden-hair flourished and gave a good smell, and
under the mossy banks of the water courses whole clumps of five-fingered ferns and goldy-backs
hung down. Then there were harebells, tiny lanterns, cream white and almost sinful looking, and
these were so rare and magi-cal that a child, finding one, felt singled out and special all day long.
When June came the grasses headed out and turned brown, and the hills turned a brown which
was not brown but a gold and saffron and red—an indescriba-ble color. And from then on until
the next rains the earth dried and the streams stopped. Cracks appeared on the level ground. The
Salinas River sank under its sand. The wind blew down the valley, picking up dust and straws,
and grew stronger and harsher as it went south. It stopped in the evening. It was a rasping nervous
wind, and the dust particles cut into a man’s skin and burned his eyes. Men working in the fields
wore goggles and tied handkerchiefs around their noses to keep the dirt out.
The valley land was deep and rich, but the foothills wore only a skin of topsoil no deeper than the
grass roots; and the farther up the hills you went, the thinner grew the soil, with flints sticking
through, until at the brush line it was a kind of dry flinty gravel that reflect-ed the hot sun
blindingly.
I have spoken of the rich years when the rainfall was plentiful. But there were dry years too, and
they put a terror on the valley. The water came in a thirty-year cycle. There would be five or six
wet and wonderful years when there might be nineteen to twenty-five inch-es of rain, and the
land would shout with grass. Then would come six or seven pretty good years of twelve to
sixteen inches of rain. And then the dry years would come, and sometimes there would be only
seven or eight inches of rain. The land dried up and the grasses headed out miserably a few
inches high and great bare scabby places appeared in the valley. The live oaks got a crusty look

and the sagebrush was gray. The land cracked and the springs dried up and the cattle listlessly
nibbled dry twigs. Then the farmers and the ranchers would be filled with disgust for the Salinas
Valley. The cows would grow thin and sometimes starve to death. People would have to haul
water in barrels to their farms just for drinking. Some families would sell out for nearly nothing
and move away. And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich
years, and during the wet years they lost all memo-ry of the dry years. It was always that way.

2
And that was the long Salinas Valley. Its history was like that of the rest of the state. First there
were Indi-ans, an inferior breed without energy, inventiveness, or culture, a people that lived on
grubs and grasshoppers and shellfish, too lazy to hunt or fish. They ate what they could pick up
and planted nothing. They pounded bitter acorns for flour. Even their warfare was a weary
pantomime.
Then the hard, dry Spaniards came exploring through, greedy and realistic, and their greed was
for gold or God. They collected souls as they collected jewels. They gathered mountains and
valleys, rivers and whole horizons, the way a man might now gain title to building lots. These
tough, dried-up men moved rest-lessly up the coast and down. Some of them stayed on grants as
large as principalities, given to them by Span-ish kings who had not the faintest idea of the gift.
These first owners lived in poor feudal settlements, and their cattle ranged freely and multiplied.
Periodically the owners killed the cattle for their hides and tallow and left the meat to the vultures
and coyotes.
When the Spaniards came they had to give every-thing they saw a name. This is the first duty of
any explorer—a duty and a privilege. You must name a thing before you can note it on your handdrawn map. Of course they were religious people, and the men who could read and write, who
kept the records and drew the maps, were the tough untiring priests who traveled with the
soldiers. Thus the first names of places were saints’ names or religious holidays celebrated at
stop-ping places. There are many saints, but they are not inexhaustible, so that we find repetitions
in the first namings. We have San Miguel, St. Michael, San Ardo, San Bernardo, San Benito, San
Lorenzo, San Carlos, San Francisquito. And then the holidays—Natividad, the Nativity;
Nacimiente, the Birth; Soledad, the Soli-tude. But places were also named from the way the
expedition felt at the time: Buena Esperenza, good hope; Buena Vista because the view was
beautiful; and Chualar because it was pretty. The descriptive names followed: Paso de los Robles
because of the oak trees; Los Laureles for the laurels; Tularcitos because of the reeds in the
swamp; and Salinas for the alkali which was white as salt.
Then places were named for animals and birds seen—Gabilanes for the hawks which flew in
those moun-tains; Topo for the mole; Los Gatos for the wild cats. The suggestions sometimes
came from the nature of the place itself: Tassajara, a cup and saucer; Laguna Seca, a dry lake;
Corral de Tierra for a fence of earth; Paraiso because it was like Heaven.
Then the Americans came—more greedy because there were more of them. They took the lands,
remade the laws to make their titles good. And farmholds spread over the land, first in the valleys

and then up the foothill slopes, small wooden houses roofed with red-wood shakes, corrals of
split poles. Wherever a trickle of water came out of the ground a house sprang up and a family
began to grow and multiply. Cuttings of red geraniums and rosebushes were planted in the
dooryards. Wheel tracks of buckboards replaced the trails, and fields of corn and barley and
wheat squared out of the yellow mustard. Every ten miles along the traveled routes a general
store and blacksmith shop happened, and these became the nuclei of little towns, Bradley, King
City, Greenfield.
The Americans had a greater tendency to name pla-ces for people than had the Spanish. After the
valleys were settled the names of places refer more to things which happened there, and these to
me are the most fascinating of all names because each name suggests a story that has been
forgotten. I think of Bolsa Nueva, a new purse; Morocojo, a lame Moor (who was he and how did
he get there?); Wild Horse Canyon and Mustang Grade and Shirt Tail Canyon. The names of
places carry a charge of the people who named them, reverent or irreverent, descriptive, either
poetic or disparaging. You can name anything San Lorenzo, but Shirt Tail Canyon or the Lame
Moor is something quite different.
The wind whistled over the settlements in the after-noon, and the farmers began to set out milelong wind-breaks of eucalyptus to keep the plowed topsoil from blowing away. And this is about
the way the Salinas Valley was when my grandfather brought his wife and settled in the foothills
to the east of King City.

Chapter 2
1
I must depend on hearsay, on old photographs, on stories told, and on memories which are hazy
and mixed with fable in trying to tell you about the Hamiltons. They were not eminent people,
and there are few records concerning them except for the usual papers on birth, marriage, land
ownership, and death.
Young Samuel Hamilton came from the north of Ireland and so did his wife. He was the son of
small farmers, neither rich nor poor, who had lived on one landhold and in one stone house for
many hundreds of years. The Hamiltons managed to be remarkably well educated and well read;
and, as is so often true in that green country, they were connected and related to very great people
and very small people, so that one cousin might be a baronet and another cousin a beggar. And of
course they were descended from the ancient kings of Ireland, as every Irishman is.
Why Samuel left the stone house and the green acres of his ancestors I do not know. He was
never a political man, so it is not likely a charge of rebellion drove him out, and he was
scrupulously honest, which eliminates the police as prime movers. There was a whisper—not
even a rumor but rather an unsaid feeling—in my family that it was love drove him out, and not
love of the wife he married. But whether it was too successful love or whether he left in pique at
unsuccessful love, I do not know. We always preferred to think it was the former. Samuel had
good looks and charm and gaiety. It is hard to imagine that any country Irish girl refused him.
He came to the Salinas Valley full-blown and hearty, full of inventions and energy. His eyes were
very blue, and when he was tired one of them wandered outward a little. He was a big man but
delicate in a way. In the dusty business of ranching he seemed always immacu-late. His hands
were clever. He was a good blacksmith and carpenter and woodcarver, and he could improvise
anything with bits of wood and metal. He was forever inventing a new way of doing an old thing
and doing it better and quicker, but he never in his whole life had any talent for making money.
Other men who had the talent took Samuel’s tricks and sold them and grew rich, but Samuel
barely made wages all his life.
I don’t know what directed his steps toward the Salinas Valley. It was an unlikely place for a man
from a green country to come to, but he came about thirty years before the turn of the century and
he brought with him his tiny Irish wife, a tight hard little woman humorless as a chicken. She had
a dour Presbyterian mind and a code of morals that pinned down and beat the brains out of nearly
everything that was pleasant to do.
I do not know where Samuel met her, how he wooed her, married. I think there must have been
some other girl printed somewhere in his heart, for he was a man of love and his wife was not a
woman to show her feelings. And in spite of this, in all the years from his youth to his death in

the Salinas Valley, there was no hint that Samuel ever went to any other woman.
When Samuel and Liza came to the Salinas Valley all the level land was taken, the rich bottoms,
the little fertile creases in the hills, the forests, but there was still marginal land to be
homesteaded, and in the barren hills, to the east of what is now King City, Samuel Hamilton
homesteaded.
He followed the usual practice. He took a quarter-section for himself and a quarter-section for his
wife, and since she was pregnant he took a quarter-section for the child. Over the years nine
children were born, four boys and five girls, and with each birth another quarter-section was
added to the ranch, and that makes eleven quarter-sections, or seventeen hundred and sixty acres.
If the land had been any good the Hamiltons would have been rich people. But the acres were
harsh and dry. There were no springs, and the crust of topsoil was so thin that the flinty bones
stuck through. Even the sagebrush struggled to exist, and the oaks were dwarfed from lack of
moisture. Even in reasonably good years there was so little feed that the cattle kept thin running
about looking for enough to eat. From their barren hills the Hamiltons could look down to the
west and see the richness of the bottom land and the greenness around the Salinas River.
Samuel built his house with his own hands, and he built a barn and a blacksmith shop. He found
quite soon that even if he had ten thousand acres of hill country he could not make a living on the
bony soil without water. His clever hands built a well-boring rig, and he bored wells on the lands
of luckier men. He invented and built a threshing machine and moved through the bottom farms
in harvest time, threshing the grain his own farm would not raise. And in his shop he sharpened
plows and mended harrows and welded bro-ken axles and shod horses. Men from all over the
district brought him tools to mend and to improve. Besides, they loved to hear Samuel talk of the
world and its thinking, of the poetry and philosophy that were going on outside the Salinas
Valley. He had a rich deep voice, good both in song and in speech, and while he had no brogue
there was a rise and a lilt and a cadence to his talk that made it sound sweet in the ears of the
taciturn farmers from the valley bottom. They brought whisky too, and out of sight of the kitchen
window and the disapproving eye of Mrs. Hamilton they took hot nips from the bottle and
nibbled cuds of green wild anise to cover the whisky breath. It was a bad day when three or four
men were not standing around the forge, listening to Samuel’s hammer and his talk. They called
him a comical genius and carried his stories carefully home, and they wondered at how the stories
spilled out on the way, for they never sounded the same repeated in their own kitchens.
Samuel should have been rich from his well rig and his threshing machine and his shop, but he
had no gift for business. His customers, always pressed for money, promised payment after
harvest, and then after Christ-mas, and then after—until at last they forgot it. Samuel had no gift
for reminding them. And so the Hamiltons stayed poor.
The children came along as regularly as the years. The few overworked doctors of the county did
not often get to the ranches for a birth unless the joy turned nightmare and went on for several
days. Samuel Hamil-ton delivered all his own children and tied the cords neatly, spanked the
bottoms and cleaned up the mess. When his youngest was born with some small obstruc-tion and
began to turn black, Samuel put his mouth against the baby’s mouth and blew air in and sucked it

out until the baby could take over for himself. Samuel’s hands were so good and gentle that
neighbors from twenty miles away would call on him to help with a birth. And he was equally
good with mare, cow, or woman.
Samuel had a great black book on an available shelf and it had gold letters on the cover—Dr.
Gunn’s Fami-ly Medicine. Some pages were bent and beat up from use, and others were never
opened to the light. To look through Dr. Gunn is to know the Hamiltons’ medical history. These
are the used sections—broken bones, cuts, bruises, mumps, measles, backache, scarlet fever,
diphtheria, rheumatism, female complaints, hernia, and of course everything to do with
pregnancy and the birth of children. The Hamiltons must have been either lucky or moral for the
sections on gonorrhea and syphilis were never opened.
Samuel had no equal for soothing hysteria and bring-ing quiet to a frightened child. It was the
sweetness of his tongue and the tenderness of his soul. And just as there was a cleanness about
his body, so there was a cleanness in his thinking. Men coming to his blacksmith shop to talk and
listen dropped their cursing for a while, not from any kind of restraint but automatically, as
though this were not the place for it.
Samuel kept always a foreignness. Perhaps it was in the cadence of his speech, and this had the
effect of making men, and women too, tell him things they would not tell to relatives or close
friends. His slight strangeness set him apart and made him safe as a repository.
Liza Hamilton was a very different kettle of Irish. Her head was small and round and it held small
round convictions. She had a button nose and a hard little set-back chin, a gripping jaw set on its
course even though the angels of God argued against it.
Liza was a good plain cook, and her house—it was always her house—was brushed and
pummeled and washed. Bearing her children did not hold her back very much—two weeks at the
most she had to be careful. She must have had a pelvic arch of whalebone, for she had big
children one after the other.
Liza had a finely developed sense of sin. Idleness was a sin, and card playing, which was a kind
of idleness to her. She was suspicious of fun whether it involved dancing or singing or even
laughter. She felt that people having a good time were wide open to the devil. And this was a
shame, for Samuel was a laughing man, but I guess Samuel was wide open to the devil. His wife
protected him whenever she could.
She wore her hair always pulled tight back and bunned behind in a hard knot. And since I can’t
remember how she dressed, it must have been that she wore clothes that matched herself exactly.
She had no spark of humor and only occasionally a blade of cutting wit. She frightened her
grandchildren because she had no weakness. She suffered bravely and uncomplainingly through
life, convinced that that was the way her God wanted everyone to live. She felt that rewards came
later.

2
When people first came to the West, particularly from the owned and fought-over farmlets of
Europe, and saw so much land to be had for the signing of a paper and the building of a

foundation, an itching land-greed seemed to come over them. They wanted more and more land—
good land if possible, but land anyway. Perhaps they had filaments of memory of feudal Eu-rope
where great families became and remained great because they owned things. The early settlers
took up land they didn’t need and couldn’t use; they took up worthless land just to own it. And all
proportions changed. A man who might have been well-to-do on ten acres in Europe was rat-poor
on two thousand in California.
It wasn’t very long until all the land in the barren hills near King City and San Ardo was taken
up, and ragged families were scattered through the hills, trying their best to scratch a living from
the thin flinty soil. They and the coyotes lived clever, despairing, submarginal lives. They landed
with no money, no equipment, no tools, no credit, and particularly with no knowledge of the new
country and no technique for using it. I don’t know whether it was a divine stupidity or a great
faith that let them do it. Surely such venture is nearly gone from the world. And the families did
survive and grow. They had a tool or a weapon that is also nearly gone, or perhaps it is only
dormant for a while. It is argued that because they believed thoroughly in a just, moral God they
could put their faith there and let the smaller securities take care of themselves. But I think that
because they trusted themselves and respected themselves as individuals, because they knew
beyond doubt that they were valuable and potentially moral units—because of this they could
give God their own courage and dignity and then receive it back. Such things have disappeared
perhaps because men do not trust themselves any more, and when that happens there is nothing
left except perhaps to find some strong sure man, even though he may be wrong, and to dangle
from his coattails.
While many people came to the Salinas Valley pen-niless, there were others who, having sold out
some-where else, arrived with money to start a new life. These usually bought land, but good
land, and built their houses of planed lumber and had carpets and colored-glass diamond panes in
their windows. There were numbers of these families and they got the good land of the valley and
cleared the yellow mustard away and planted wheat.
Such a man was Adam Trask.

Chapter 3
1
Adam Trask was born on a farm on the outskirts of a little town which was not far from a big
town in Connecticut. He was an only son, and he was born six months after his father was
mustered into a Connecti-cut regiment in 1862. Adam’s mother ran the farm, bore Adam, and
still had time to embrace a primitive theosophy. She felt that her husband would surely be killed
by the wild and barbarous rebels, and she prepared herself to get in touch with him in what she
called the beyond. He came home six weeks after Adam was born. His right leg was off at the
knee. He stumped in on a crude wooden leg he himself had carved out of beechwood. And
already it was splitting. He had in his pocket and placed on the parlor table the lead bullet they
had given him to bite while they cut off his frayed leg.
Adam’s father Cyrus was something of a devil—had always been wild—drove a two-wheeled
cart too fast, and managed to make his wooden leg seem jaunty and desirable. He had enjoyed his
military career, what there was of it. Being wild by nature, he had liked his brief period of
training and the drinking and gambling and whoring that went with it. Then he marched south
with a group of replacements, and he enjoyed that too—seeing the country and stealing chickens
and chas-ing rebel girls up into the haystacks. The gray, despair-ing weariness of protracted
maneuvers and combat did not touch him. The first time he saw the enemy was at eight o’clock
one spring morning, and at eight-thirty he was hit in the right leg by a heavy slug that mashed and
splintered the bones beyond repair. Even then he was lucky, for the rebels retreated and the field
surgeons moved up immediately. Cyrus Trask did have his five minutes of horror while they cut
the shreds away and sawed the bone off square and burned the open flesh. The toothmarks in the
bullet proved that. And there was considerable pain while the wound healed under the unusually
septic conditions in the hospitals of that day. But Cyrus had vitality and swagger. While he was
carving his beechwood leg and hobbling about on a crutch, he contracted a particularly virulent
dose of the clap from a Negro girl who whistled at him from under a pile of lumber and charged
him ten cents. When he had his new leg, and painfully knew his condition, he hobbled about for
days, looking for the girl. He told his bunkmates what he was going to do when he found her. He
planned to cut off her ears and her nose with his pocketknife and get his money back. Carving on
his wooden leg, he showed his friends how he would cut her. “When I finish her she’ll be a funnylooking bitch,” he said. “I’ll make her so a drunk Indian won’t take out after her.” His light of
love must have sensed his intentions, for he never found her. By the time Cyrus was released
from the hospital and the army, his gonorrhea was dried up. When he got home to Con-necticut
there remained only enough of it for his wife.
Mrs. Trask was a pale, inside-herself woman. No heat of sun ever reddened her cheeks, and no

open laughter raised the corners of her mouth. She used religion as a therapy for the ills of the
world and of herself, and she changed the religion to fit the ill. When she found that the
theosophy she had developed for communication with a dead husband was not neces-sary, she
cast about for some new unhappiness. Her search was quickly rewarded by the infection Cyrus
brought home from the war. And as soon as she was aware that a condition existed, she devised a
new theol-ogy. Her god of communication became a god of ven-geance—to her the most
satisfactory deity she had devised so far—and, as it turned out, the last. It was quite easy for her
to attribute her condition to certain dreams she had experienced while her husband was away. But
the disease was not punishment enough for her nocturnal philandering. Her new god was an
expert in punishment. He demanded of her a sacrifice. She searched her mind for some proper
egotistical humility and almost happily arrived at the sacrifice—herself. It took her two weeks to
write her last letter with revisions and corrected spelling. In it she confessed to crimes she could
not possibly have committed and admitted faults far beyond her capacity. And then, dressed in a
secretly made shroud, she went out on a moonlight night and drowned herself in a pond so
shallow that she had to get down on her knees in the mud and hold her head under water. This
required great will power. As the warm unconsciousness finally crept over her, she was thinking
with some irritation of how her white lawn shroud would have mud down the front when they
pulled her out in the morning. And it did.
Cyrus Trask mourned for his wife with a keg of whisky and three old army friends who had
dropped in on their way home to Maine. Baby Adam cried a good deal at the beginning of the
wake, for the mourners, not knowing about babies, had neglected to feed him. Cyrus soon solved
the problem. He dipped a rag in whisky and gave it to the baby to suck, and after three or four
dippings young Adam went to sleep. Several times during the mourning period he awakened and
complained and got the dipped rag again and went to sleep. The baby was drunk for two days and
a half. Whatever may have happened in his developing brain, it proved beneficial to his
metabolism: from that two and a half days he gained an iron health. And when at the end of three
days his father finally went out and bought a goat, Adam drank the milk greedily, vomited, drank
more, and was on his way. His father did not find the reaction alarming, since he was doing the
same thing.
Within a month Cyrus Trask’s choice fell on the seventeen-year-old daughter of a neighboring
farmer. The courtship was quick and realistic. There was no doubt in anybody’s mind about his
intentions. They were honorable and reasonable. Her father abetted the courtship. He had two
younger daughters, and Alice, the eldest, was seventeen. This was her first proposal.
Cyrus wanted a woman to take care of Adam. He needed someone to keep house and cook, and a
servant cost money. He was a vigorous man and needed the body of a woman, and that too cost
money—unless you were married to it. Within two weeks Cyrus had wooed, wedded, bedded,
and impregnated her. His neighbors did not find his action hasty. It was quite normal in that day
for a man to use up three or four wives in a normal lifetime.
Alice Trask had a number of admirable qualities. She was a deep scrubber and a corner-cleaner in
the house. She was not very pretty, so there was no need to watch her. Her eyes were pale, her

complexion sallow, and her teeth crooked, but she was extremely healthy and never complained
during her pregnancy. Whether she liked children or not no one ever knew. She was not asked,
and she never said anything unless she was asked. From Cyrus’s point of view this was possibly
the greatest of her virtues. She never offered any opinion or statement, and when a man was
talking she gave a vague impression of listening while she went about doing the housework.
The youth, inexperience, and taciturnity of Alice Trask all turned out to be assets for Cyrus.
While he continued to operate his farm as such farms were oper-ated in the neighborhood, he
entered on a new career—that of the old soldier. And that energy which had made him wild now
made him thoughtful. No one now outside of the War Department knew the quality and duration
of his service. His wooden leg was at once a certificate of proof of his soldiering and a guarantee
that he wouldn’t ever have to do it again. Timidly he began to tell Alice about his campaigns, but
as his technique grew so did his battles. At the very first he knew he was lying, but it was not
long before he was equally sure that every one of his stories was true. Before he had entered the
service he had not been much interested in warfare; now he bought every book about war, read
every report, subscribed to the New York papers, studied maps. His knowledge of geogra-phy
had been shaky and his information about the fighting nonexistent; now he became an authority.
He knew not only the battles, movements, campaigns, but also the units involved, down to the
regiments, their colonels, and where they originated. And from telling he became convinced that
he had been there.
All of this was a gradual development, and it took place while Adam was growing to boyhood
and his young half-brother behind him. Adam and little Charles would sit silent and respectful
while their father explained how every general thought and planned and where they had made
their mistakes and what they should have done. And then—he had known it at the time—he had
told Grant and McClellan where they were wrong and had begged them to take his analysis of the
situation. Invariably they refused his advice and only afterward was he proved right.
There was one thing Cyrus did not do, and perhaps it was clever of him. He never once promoted
himself to noncommissioned rank. Private Trask he began, and Private Trask he remained. In the
total telling, it made him at once the most mobile and ubiquitous private in the history of warfare.
It made it necessary for him to be in as many as four places at once. But perhaps instinctively he
did not tell those stories close to each other. Alice and the boys had a complete picture of him: a
private soldier, and proud of it, who not only hap-pened to be where every spectacular and
important action was taking place but who wandered freely into staff meetings and joined or
dissented in the decisions of general officers.
The death of Lincoln caught Cyrus in the pit of the stomach. Always he remembered how he felt
when he first heard the news. And he could never mention it or hear of it without quick tears in
his eyes. And while he never actually said it, you got the indestructible impres-sion that Private
Cyrus Trask was one of Lincoln’s closest, warmest, and most trusted friends. When Mr. Lincoln
wanted to know about the army, the real army, not those prancing dummies in gold braid, he
turned to Private Trask. How Cyrus managed to make this understood without saying it was a
triumph of insinuation. No one could call him a liar. And this was mainly because the lie was in

his head, and any truth coming from his mouth carried the color of the lie.
Quite early he began to write letters and then articles about the conduct of the war, and his
conclusions were intelligent and convincing. Indeed, Cyrus developed an excellent military mind.
His criticisms both of the war as it had been conducted and of the army organization as it
persisted were irresistibly penetrating. His articles in various magazines attracted attention. His
letters to the War Department, printed simultaneously in the newspapers, began to have a sharp
effect in decisions on the army. Perhaps if the Grand Army of the Repub-lic had not assumed
political force and direction his voice might not have been heard so clearly in Washing-ton, but
the spokesman for a block of nearly a million men was not to be ignored. And such a voice in
mili-tary matters Cyrus Trask became. It came about that he was consulted in matters of army
organization, in officer relationships, in personnel and equipment. His expertness was apparent to
everyone who heard him. He had a genius for the military. More than that, he was one of those
responsible for the organization of the G.A.R. as a cohesive and potent force in the national life.
After several unpaid offices in that organization, he took a paid secretaryship which he kept for
the rest of his life. He traveled from one end of the country to the other, attending conventions,
meetings, and encamp-ments. So much for his public life.
His private life was also laced through with his new profession. He was a man devoted. His house
and farm he organized on a military basis. He demanded and got reports on the conduct of his
private economy. It is probable that Alice preferred it this way. She was not a talker. A terse
report was easiest for her. She was busy with the growing boys and with keeping the house clean
and the clothes washed. Also, she had to conserve her energy, though she did not mention this in
any of her reports. Without warning her energy would leave her, and she would have to sit down
and wait until it came back. In the night she would be drenched with perspi-ration. She knew
perfectly well that she had what was called consumption, would have known even if she was not
reminded by a hard, exhausting cough. And she did not know how long she would live. Some
people wasted on for quite a few years. There wasn’t any rule about it. Perhaps she didn’t dare to
mention it to her hus-band. He had devised a method for dealing with sick-ness which resembled
punishment. A stomach ache was treated with a purge so violent that it was a wonder anyone
survived it. If she had mentioned her condition, Cyrus might have started a treatment which
would have killed her off before her consumption could have done it. Besides, as Cyrus became
more military, his wife learned the only technique through which a soldier can survive. She never
made herself noticeable, never spoke unless spoken to, performed what was expected and no
more, and tried for no promotions. She became a rear rank private. It was much easier that way.
Alice retired to the background until she was barely visible at all.
It was the little boys who really caught it. Cyrus had decided that even though the army was not
perfect, it was still the only honorable profession for a man. He mourned the fact that he could
not be a permanent soldier because of his wooden leg, but he could not imagine any career for his
sons except the army. He felt a man should learn soldiering from the ranks, as he had. Then he
would know what it was about from experience, not from charts and textbooks. He taught them
the manual of arms when they could barely walk. By the time they were in grade school, close-

order drill was as natural as breathing and as hateful as hell. He kept them hard with exercises,
beating out the rhythm with a stick on his wooden leg. He made them walk for miles, carrying
knapsacks loaded with stones to make their shoulders strong. He worked constantly on their
marksmanship in the woodlot behind the house.

When a child first catches adults out—when it first walks into his grave little head that adults do
not have divine intelligence, that their judgments are not always wise, their thinking true, their
sentences just—his world falls into panic desolation. The gods are fallen and all safety gone. And
there is one sure thing about the fall of gods: they do not fall a little; they crash and shatter or sink
deeply into green muck. It is a tedious job to build them up again; they never quite shine. And the
child’s world is never quite whole again. It is an aching kind of growing.
Adam found his father out. It wasn’t that his father changed but that some new quality came to
Adam. He had always hated the discipline, as every normal ani-mal does, but it was just and true
and inevitable as measles, not to be denied or cursed, only to be hated. And then—it was very
fast, almost a click in the brain—Adam knew that, for him at least, his father’s methods had no
reference to anything in the world but his father. The techniques and training were not de-signed
for the boys at all but only to make Cyrus a great man. And the same click in the brain told Adam
that his father was not a great man, that he was, indeed, a very strong-willed and concentrated
little man wearing a huge busby. Who knows what causes this—a look in the eye, a lie found out,
a moment of hesitation?—then god comes crashing down in a child’s brain.
Young Adam was always an obedient child. Some-thing in him shrank from violence, from
contention, from the silent shrieking tensions that can rip at a house. He contributed to the quiet
he wished for by offering no violence, no contention, and to do this he had to retire into
secretness, since there is some vio-lence in everyone. He covered his life with a veil of
vagueness, while behind his quiet eyes a rich full life went on. This did not protect him from
assault but it allowed him an immunity.
His half-brother Charles, only a little over a year younger, grew up with his father’s assertiveness.
Charles was a natural athlete, with instinctive timing and coordination and the competitor’s will
to win over others, which makes for success in the world.
Young Charles won all contests with Adam whether they involved skill, or strength, or quick
intelligence, and won them so easily that quite early he lost interest and had to find his
competition among other children. Thus it came about that a kind of affection grew up between
the two boys, but it was more like an associa-tion between brother and sister than between
brothers. Charles fought any boy who challenged or slurred Adam and usually won. He protected
Adam from his father’s harshness with lies and even with blame-taking. Charles felt for his
brother the affection one has for helpless things, for blind puppies and new babies.
Adam looked out of his covered brain—out the long tunnels of his eyes—at the people of his
world: His father, a one-legged natural force at first, installed justly to make little boys feel littler
and stupid boys aware of their stupidity; and then—after god had crashed—he saw his father as

the policeman laid on by birth, the officer who might be circumvented, or fooled, but never
challenged. And out of the long tunnels of his eyes Adam saw his half-brother Charles as a bright
being of another species, gifted with muscle and bone, speed and alertness, quite on a different
plane, to be admired as one admires the sleek lazy danger of a black leopard, not by any chance
to be compared with one’s self. And it would no more have occurred to Adam to confide in his
brother—to tell him the hunger, the gray dreams, the plans and silent pleasures that lay at the
back of the tunneled eyes—than to share his thoughts with a lovely tree or a pheasant in flight.
Adam was glad of Charles the way a woman is glad of a fat diamond, and he depended on his
brother in the way that same woman depends on the diamond’s glitter and the self-security tied
up in its worth; but love, affection, empathy, were beyond conception.
Toward Alice Trask, Adam concealed a feeling that was akin to a warm shame. She was not his
mother—that he knew because he had been told many times. Not from things said but from the
tone in which other things were said, he knew that he had once had a mother and that she had
done some shameful thing, such as forgetting the chickens or missing the target on the range in
the woodlot. And as a result of her fault she was not here. Adam thought sometimes that if he
could only find out what sin it was she had committed, why, he would sin it too—and not be here.
Alice treated the boys equally, washed them and fed them, and left everything else to their father,
who had let it be known clearly and with finality that training the boys physically and mentally
was his exclusive province. Even praise and reprimand he would not delegate. Alice never
complained, quarreled, laughed, or cried. Her mouth was trained to a line that concealed nothing
and offered nothing too. But once when Adam was quite small he wandered silently into the
kitchen. Alice did not see him. She was darning socks and she was smiling. Adam retired secretly
and walked out of the house and into the woodlot to a sheltered place behind a stump that he
knew well. He settled deep between the protecting roots. Adam was as shocked as though he had
come upon her naked. He breathed excitedly, high against his throat. For Alice had been naked—
she had been smiling. He wondered how she had dared such wantonness. And he ached toward
her with a longing that was passionate and hot. He did not know what it was about, but all the
long lack of holding, of rocking, of caressing, the hunger for breast and nipple, and the softness
of a lap, and the voice-tone of love and compassion, and the sweet feeling of anxiety—all of
these were in his passion, and he did not know it because he did not know that such things
existed, so how could he miss them?
Of course it occurred to him that he might be wrong, that some misbegotten shadow had fallen
across his face and warped his seeing. And so he cast back to the sharp picture in his head and
knew that the eyes were smiling too. Twisted light could do one or the other but not both.
He stalked her then, game-wise, as he had the wood-chucks on the knoll when day after day he
had lain lifeless as a young stone and watched the old wary chucks bring their children out to sun.
He spied on Alice, hidden, and from unsuspected eye-corner, and it was true. Sometimes when
she was alone, and knew she was alone, she permitted her mind to play in a garden, and she
smiled. And it was wonderful to see how quickly she could drive the smile to earth the way the
woodchucks holed their children.

Adam concealed his treasure deep in his tunnels, but he was inclined to pay for his pleasure with
something. Alice began to find gifts—in her sewing basket, in her worn-out purse, under her
pillow—two cinnamon pinks, a bluebird’s tailfeather, half a stick of green sealing wax, a stolen
handkerchief. At first Alice was startled, but then that passed, and when she found some
unsuspected present the garden smile flashed and disappeared the way a trout crosses a knife of
sunshine in a pool. She asked no questions and made no com-ment.
Her coughing was very bad at night, so loud and disturbing that Cyrus had at last to put her in
another room or he would have got no sleep. But he did visit her very often—hopping on his one
bare foot, steady-ing himself with hand on wall. The boys could hear and feel the jar of his body
through the house as he hopped to and from Alice’s bed.
As Adam grew he feared one thing more than any other. He feared the day he would be taken and
en-listed in the army. His father never let him forget that such a time would come. He spoke of it
often. It was Adam who needed the army to make a man of him. Charles was pretty near a man
already. And Charles was a man, and a dangerous man, even at fifteen, and when Adam was
sixteen.

3
The affection between the two boys had grown with the years. It may be that part of Charles’
feeling was contempt, but it was a protective contempt. It hap-pened that one evening the boys
were playing peewee, a new game to them, in the dooryard. A small pointed stick was laid on the
ground, then struck near one end with a bat. The small stick flew into the air and then was batted
as far as possible.
Adam was not good at games. But by some accident of eye and timing he beat his brother at
peewee. Four times he drove the peewee farther than Charles did. It was a new experience to him,
and a wild flush came over him, so that he did not watch and feel out his brother’s mood as he
usually did. The fifth time he drove the peewee it flew humming like a bee far out in the field. He
turned happily to face Charles and suddenly he froze deep in his chest. The hatred in Charles’
face frightened him. “I guess it was just an accident,” he said lamely. “I bet I couldn’t do it again.”
Charles set his peewee, struck it, and, as it rose into the air, swung at it and missed. Charles
moved slowly toward Adam, his eyes cold and noncommittal. Adam edged away in terror. He did
not dare to turn and run for his brother could outrun him. He backed slowly away, his eyes
frightened and his throat dry. Charles moved close and struck him in the face with his bat. Adam
covered his bleeding nose with his hands, and Charles swung his bat and hit him in the ribs,
knocked the wind out of him, swung at his head and knocked him out. And as Adam lay
unconscious on the ground Charles kicked him heavily in the stomach and walked away.
After a while Adam became conscious. He breathed shallowly because his chest hurt. He tried to
sit up and fell back at the wrench of the torn muscles over his stomach. He saw Alice looking out,
and there was something in her face that he had never seen before. He did not know what it was,
but it was not soft or weak, and it might be hatred. She saw that he was looking at her, dropped
the curtains into place, and disappeared. When Adam finally got up from the ground and moved,

bent over, into the kitchen, he found a basin of hot water standing ready for him and a clean towel
beside it. He could hear his stepmother coughing in her room.
Charles had one great quality. He was never sorry—-ever. He never mentioned the beating,
apparently never thought of it again. But Adam made very sure that he didn’t win again—at
anything. He had always felt the danger in his brother, but now he understood that he must never
win unless he was prepared to kill Charles. Charles was not sorry. He had very simply fulfilled
himself.
Charles did not tell his father about the beating, and Adam did not, and surely Alice did not, and
yet he seemed to know. In the months that followed he turned a gentleness on Adam. His speech
became softer toward him. He did not punish him any more. Almost nightly he lectured him, but
not violently. And Adam was more afraid of the gentleness than he had been at the violence, for it
seemed to him that he was be-ing trained as a sacrifice, almost as though he was being subjected
to kindness before death, the way victims intended to the gods were cuddled and flattered so that
they might go happily to the stone and not outrage the gods with unhappiness.
Cyrus explained softly to Adam the nature of a soldier. And though his knowledge came from
research rather than experience, he knew and he was accurate. He told his son of the sad dignity
that can belong to a soldier, how he is necessary in the light of all the failures of man—the
penalty of our frailties. Perhaps Cyrus discovered these things in himself as he told them. It was
very different from the flag-waving, shouting bellicosity of his younger days. The humilities are
piled on a soldier, so Cyrus said, in order that he may, when the time comes, be not too resentful
of the final humility—a meaningless and dirty death. And Cyrus talked to Adam alone and did
not permit Charles to listen.
Cyrus took Adam to walk with him one late after-noon, and the black conclusions of all of his
study and his thinking came out and flowed with a kind of thick terror over his son. He said, “I’ll
have you know that a soldier is the most holy of all humans because he is the most tested—most
tested of all. I’ll try to tell you. Look now—in all of history men have been taught that killing of
men is an evil thing not to be countenanced. Any man who kills must be destroyed because this is
a great sin, maybe the worst sin we know. And then we take a soldier and put murder in his hands
and we say to him, ‘Use it well, use it wisely.’ We put no checks on him. Go out and kill as many
of a certain kind or classification of your brothers as you can. And we will reward you for it
because it is a violation of your early training.”
Adam wet his dry lips and tried to ask and failed and tried again. “Why do they have to do it?” he
said. “Why is it?”
Cyrus was deeply moved and he spoke as he had never spoken before. “I don’t know,” he said.
“I’ve studied and maybe learned how things are, but I’m not even close to why they are. And you
must not expect to find that people understand what they do. So many things are done
instinctively, the way a bee makes honey or a fox dips his paws in a stream to fool dogs. A fox
can’t say why he does it, and what bee remem-bers winter or expects it to come again? When I
knew you had to go I thought to leave the future open so you could dig out your own findings,
and then it seemed better if I could protect you with the little I know. You’ll go in soon now—

you’ve come to the age.”
“I don’t want to,” said Adam quickly.
“You’ll go in soon,” his father went on, not hearing. “And I want to tell you so you won’t be
surprised. They’ll first strip off your clothes, but they’ll go deeper than that. They’ll shuck off
any little dignity you have—you’ll lose what you think of as your decent right to live and to be let
alone to live. They’ll make you live and eat and sleep and shit close to other men. And when they
dress you up again you’ll not be able to tell yourself from the others. You can’t even wear a scrap
or pin a note on your breast to say, ‘This is me—separate from the rest.’ ”
“I don’t want to do it,” said Adam.
“After a while,” said Cyrus, “you’ll think no thought the others do not think. You’ll know no
word the others can’t say. And you’ll do things because the oth-ers do them. You’ll feel the
danger in any difference whatever—a danger to the whole crowd of like-thinking, like-acting
men.”
“What if I don’t?” Adam demanded.
“Yes,” said Cyrus, “sometimes that happens. Once in a while there is a man who won’t do what
is demanded of him, and do you know what happens? The whole machine devotes itself coldly to
the destruction of his difference. They’ll beat your spirit and your nerves, your body and your
mind, with iron rods until the dangerous difference goes out of you. And if you can’t finally give
in, they’ll vomit you up and leave you stinking outside—neither part of themselves nor yet free.
It’s better to fall in with them. They only do it to protect themselves. A thing so triumphantly
illogical, so beautifully senseless as an army can’t allow a question to weaken it. Within itself, if
you do not hold it up to other things for comparison and derision, you’ll find slowly, surely, a
reason and a logic and a kind of dreadful beauty. A man who can accept it is not a worse man
always, and sometimes is a much better man. Pay good heed to me for I have thought long about
it. Some men there are who go down the dismal wrack of soldiering, surrender themselves, and
become faceless. But these had not much face to start with. And maybe you’re like that. But there
are others who go down, submerge in the common slough, and then rise more themselves than
they were, because—because they have lost a littleness of vanity and have gained all the gold of
the company and the regiment. If you can go down so low, you will be able to rise higher than
you can conceive, and you will know a holy joy, a companionship almost like that of a heavenly
company of angels. Then you will know the quality of men even if they are inarticulate. But until
you have gone way down you can never know this.”
As they walked back toward the house Cyrus turned left and entered the woodlot among the trees,
and it was dusk. Suddenly Adam said, “You see that stump there, sir? I used to hide between the
roots on the far side. After you punished me I used to hide there, and sometimes I went there just
because I felt bad.”
“Let’s go and see the place,” his father said. Adam led him to it, and Cyrus looked down at the
nestlike hole between the roots. “I knew about it long ago,” he said. “Once when you were gone a
long time I thought you must have such a place, and I found it because I felt the kind of place you
would need. See how the earth is tamped and the little grass is torn? And while you sat in there

you stripped little pieces of bark to shreds. I knew it was the place when I came upon it.”
Adam was staring at his father in wonder. “You never came here looking for me,” he said.
“No,” Cyrus replied. “I wouldn’t do that. You can drive a human too far. I wouldn’t do that.
Always you must leave a man one escape before death. Remember that! I knew, I guess, how
hard I was pressing you. I didn’t want to push you over the edge.”
They moved restlessly off through the trees. Cyrus said, “So many things I want to tell you. I’ll
forget most of them. I want to tell you that a soldier gives up so much to get something back.
From the day of a child’s birth he is taught by every circumstance, by every law and rule and
right, to protect his own life. He starts with that great instinct, and everything confirms it. And
then he is a soldier and he must learn to violate all of this—he must learn coldly to put himself in
the way of losing his own life without going mad. And if you can do that—and, mind you, some
can’t—then you will have the greatest gift of all. Look, son,” Cyrus said earnestly, “nearly all
men are afraid, and they don’t even know what causes their fear—shadows, perplexi-ties, dangers
without names or numbers, fear of a faceless death. But if you can bring yourself to face not
shadows but real death, described and recognizable, by bullet or saber, arrow or lance, then you
need never be afraid again, at least not the same way you were before. Then you will be a man set
apart from other men, safe where other men may cry in terror. This is the great reward. Maybe
this is the only reward. Maybe this is the final purity all ringed with filth. It’s nearly dark. I’ll
want to talk to you again tomorrow night when both of us have thought about what I’ve told you.”
But Adam said, “Why don’t you talk to my brother? Charles will be going. He’ll be good at it,
much better than I am.”
“Charles won’t be going,” Cyrus said. “There’d be no point in it.”
“But he would be a better soldier.”
“Only outside on his skin,” said Cyrus. “Not inside, Charles is not afraid so he could never learn
anything about courage. He does not know anything outside himself so he could never gain the
things I’ve tried to explain to you. To put him in an army would be to let loose things which in
Charles must be chained down, not let loose. I would not dare to let him go.”
Adam complained, “You never punished him, you let him live his life, you praised him, you did
not haze him, and now you let him stay out of the army.” He stopped, frightened at what he had
said, afraid of the rage or the contempt or the violence his words might let loose.
His father did not reply. He walked on out of the woodlot, and his head hung down so that his
chin rested on his chest, and the rise and fall of his hip when his wooden leg struck the ground
was monotonous. The wooden leg made a side semicircle to get ahead when its turn came.
It was completely dark by now, and the golden light of the lamps shone out from the open kitchen
door. Alice came to the doorway and peered out, looking for them, and then she heard the uneven
footsteps ap-proaching and went back to the kitchen.
Cyrus walked to the kitchen stoop before he stopped and raised his head. “Where are you?” he
asked.
“Here—right behind you—right here.”
“You asked a question. I guess I’ll have to answer. Maybe it’s good and maybe it’s bad to answer

it. You’re not clever. You don’t know what you want. You have no proper fierceness. You let
other people walk over you. Sometimes I think you’re a weakling who will never amount to a
dog turd. Does that answer your question? I love you better. I always have. This may be a bad
thing to tell you, but it’s true. I love you better. Else why would I have given myself the trouble
of hurting you? Now shut your mouth and go to your supper. I’ll talk to you tomorrow night. My
leg aches.”

4
There was no talk at supper. The quiet was disturbed only by the slup of soup and gnash of
chewing, and his father waved his hand to try to drive the moths away from the chimney of the
kerosene lamp. Adam thought his brother watched him secretly. And he caught an eye flash from
Alice when he looked up suddenly. After he had finished eating Adam pushed back his chair. “I
think I’ll go for a walk,” he said.
Charles stood up. “I’ll go with you.”
Alice and Cyrus watched them go out the door, and then she asked one of her rare questions. She
asked nervously, “What did you do?”
“Nothing,” he said.
“Will you make him go?”
“Yes.”
“Does he know?”
Cyrus stared bleakly out the open door into the darkness. “Yes, he knows.”
“He won’t like it. It’s not right for him.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Cyrus said, and he repeated loudly, “It doesn’t matter,” and his tone said,
“Shut your mouth. This is not your affair.” They were silent a moment, and then he said almost in
a tone of apology, “It isn’t as though he were your child.”
Alice did not reply.
The boys walked down the dark rutty road. Ahead they could see a few pinched lights where the
village was.
“Want to go in and see if anything’s stirring at the inn?” Charles asked.
“I hadn’t thought of it,” said Adam.
“Then what the hell are you walking out at night for?”
“You didn’t have to come,” said Adam.
Charles moved close to him. “What did he say to you this afternoon? I saw you walking together.
What did he say?”
“He just talked about the army—like always.”
“Didn’t look like that to me,” Charles said suspi-ciously. “I saw him leaning close, talking the
way he talks to men—not telling, talking.”
“He was telling,” Adam said patiently, and he had to control his breath, for a little fear had begun
to press up against his stomach. He took as deep a gulp of air as he could and held it to push back
at the fear.

“What did he tell you?” Charles demanded again.
“About the army and how it is to be a soldier.”
“I don’t believe you,” said Charles. “I think you’re a goddam mealy-mouthed liar. What’re you
trying to get away with?”
“Nothing,” said Adam.
Charles said harshly, “Your crazy mother drowned herself. Maybe she took a look at you. That’d
do it.”
Adam let out his breath gently, pressing down the dismal fear. He was silent.
Charles cried, “You’re trying to take him away! I don’t know how you’re going about it. What do
you think you’re doing?”
“Nothing,” said Adam.
Charles jumped in front of him so that Adam had to stop, his chest almost against his brother’s
chest. Adam backed away, but carefully, as one backs away from a snake.
“Look at his birthday!” Charles shouted. “I took six bits and I bought him a knife made in
Germany—three blades and a corkscrew, pearl-handled. Where’s that knife? Do you ever see him
use it? Did he give it to you? I never even saw him hone it. Have you got that knife in your
pocket? What did he do with it? ‘Thanks,’ he said, like that. And that’s the last I heard of a pearlhandled German knife that cost six bits.”
Rage was in his voice, and Adam felt the creeping fear; but he knew also that he had a moment
left. Too many times he had seen the destructive machine that chopped down anything standing
in its way. Rage came first and then a coldness, a possession; noncommittal eyes and a pleased
smile and no voice at all, only a whisper. When that happened murder was on the way, but cool,
deft murder, and hands that worked precisely, delicately. Adam swallowed saliva to dampen his
dry throat. He could think of nothing to say that would be heard, for once in rage his brother
would not listen, would not even hear. He bulked darkly in front of Adam, shorter, wider, thicker,
but still not crouched. In the starlight his lips shone with wetness, but there was no smile yet and
his voice still raged.
“What did you do on his birthday? You think I didn’t see? Did you spend six bits or even four
bits? You brought him a mongrel pup you picked up in the woodlot. You laughed like a fool and
said it would make a good bird dog. That dog sleeps in his room. He plays with it while he’s
reading. He’s got it all trained. And where’s the knife? ‘Thanks,’ he said, just Thanks.’ ” Charles
spoke in a whisper, and his shoul-ders dropped.
Adam made one desperate jump backward and raised his hands to guard his face. His brother
moved precisely, each foot planted firmly. One fist lanced deli-cately to get the range, and then
the bitter-frozen work—a hard blow in the stomach, and Adam’s hands dropped; then four
punches to the head. Adam felt the bone and gristle of his nose crunch. He raised his hands again
and Charles drove at his heart. And all this time Adam looked at his brother as the condemned
look hopelessly and puzzled at the executioner.
Suddenly to his own surprise Adam launched a wild, overhand, harmless swing which had
neither force nor direction. Charles ducked in and under it and the help-less arm went around his

neck. Adam wrapped his arms around his brother and hung close to him, sob-bing. He felt the
square fists whipping nausea into his stomach and still he held on. Time was slowed to him. With
his body he felt his brother move sideways to force his legs apart. And he felt the knee come up,
past his knees, scraping his thighs, until it crashed against his testicles and flashing white pain
ripped and echoed through his body. His arms let go. He bent over and vomited, while the cold
killing went on.
Adam felt the punches on temples, cheeks, eyes. He felt his lip split and tatter over his teeth, but
his skin seemed thickened and dull, as though he were encased in heavy rubber. Dully he
wondered why his legs did not buckle, why he did not fall, why unconsciousness did not come to
him. The punching continued eternal-ly. He could hear his brother panting with the quick
explosive breath of a sledgehammer man, and in the sick starlit dark he could see his brother
through the tear-watered blood that flowed from his eyes. He saw the innocent, noncommittal
eyes, the small smile on wet lips. And as he saw these things—a flash of light and darkness.
Charles stood over him, gulping air like a run-out dog. And then he turned and walked quickly
back, toward the house, kneading his bruised knuckles as he went.
Consciousness came back quick and frightening to Adam. His mind rolled in a painful mist. His
body was heavy and thick with hurt. But almost instantly he forgot his hurts. He heard quick
footsteps on the road. The instinctive fear and fierceness of a rat came over him. He pushed
himself up on his knees and dragged himself off the road to the ditch that kept it drained. There
was a foot of water in the ditch, and the tall grass grew up from its sides. Adam crawled quietly
into the water, being very careful to make no splash.
The footsteps came close, slowed, moved on a little, came back. From his hiding place Adam
could see only a darkness in the dark. And then a sulphur match was struck and burned a tiny
blue until the wood caught, lighting his brother’s face grotesquely from below. Charles raised the
match and peered around, and Adam could see the hatchet in his right hand.
When the match went out the night was blacker than before. Charles moved slowly on and struck
another match, and on and struck another. He searched the road for signs. At last he gave it up.
His right hand rose and he threw the hatchet far off into the field. He walked rapidly away toward
the pinched lights of the village.
For a long time Adam lay in the cool water. He wondered how his brother felt, wondered whether
now that his passion was chilling he would feel panic or sorrow or sick conscience or nothing.
These things Adam felt for him. His conscience bridged him to his brother and did his pain for
him the way at other times he had done his homework.
Adam crept out of the water and stood up. His hurts were stiffening and the blood was dried in a
crust on his face. He thought he would stay outside in the darkness until his father and Alice went
to bed. He felt that he could not answer any questions, because he did not know any answers, and
trying to find one was harsh to his battered mind. Dizziness edged with blue lights came fringing
his forehead, and he knew that he would be fainting soon.
He shuffled slowly up the road with wide-spread legs. At the stoop he paused, looked in. The
lamp hanging by its chain from the ceiling cast a yellow circle and lighted Alice and her mending

basket on the table in front of her. On the other side his father chewed a wooden pen and dipped
it in an open ink bottle and made entries in his black record book.
Alice, glancing up, saw Adam’s bloody face. Her hand rose to her mouth and her fingers hooked
over her lower teeth.
Adam dragfooted up one step and then the other and supported himself in the doorway.
Then Cyrus raised his head. He looked with a distant curiosity. The identity of the distortion
came to him slowly. He stood up, puzzled and wondering. He stuck the wooden pen in the ink
bottle and wiped his fingers on his pants. “Why did he do it?” Cyrus asked softly.
Adam tried to answer, but his mouth was caked and dry. He licked his lips and started them
bleeding again. “I don’t know,” he said.
Cyrus stumped over to him and grasped him by the arm so fiercely that he winced and tried to
pull away. “Don’t lie to me! Why did he do it? Did you have an argument?”
“No.”
Cyrus wrenched at him. “Tell me! I want to know. Tell me! You’ll have to tell me. I’ll make you
tell me! Goddam it, you’re always protecting him! Don’t you think I know that? Did you think
you were fooling me? Now tell me, or by God I’ll keep you standing there all night!”
Adam cast about for an answer. “He doesn’t think you love him.”
Cyrus released the arm and hobbled back to his chair and sat down. He rattled the pen in the ink
bottle and looked blindly at his record book. “Alice,” he said, “help Adam to bed. You’ll have to
cut his shirt off, I guess. Give him a hand.” He got up again, went to the corner of the room where
the coats hung on nails, and, reaching behind the garments, brought out his shotgun, broke it to
verify its load, and clumped out of the door.
Alice raised her hand as though she would hold him back with a rope of air. And her rope broke
and her face hid her thoughts. “Go in your room,” she said. “I’ll bring some water in a basin.”
Adam lay on the bed, a sheet pulled up to his waist, and Alice patted the cuts with a linen
handkerchief dipped in warm water. She was silent for a long time and then she continued
Adam’s sentence as though there had never been an interval, “He doesn’t think his father loves
him. But you love him—you always have.”
Adam did not answer her.
She went on quietly, “He’s a strange boy. You have to know him—all rough shell, all anger until
you know.” She paused to cough, leaned down and coughed, and when the spell was over her
cheeks were flushed and she was exhausted. “You have to know him,” she repeated. “For a long
time he has given me little presents, pretty things you wouldn’t think he’d even notice. But he
doesn’t give them right out. He hides them where he knows I’ll find them. And you can look at
him for hours and he won’t ever give the slightest sign he did it. You have to know him.”
She smiled at Adam and he closed his eyes.

Chapter 4
1
Charles stood at the bar in the village inn and Charles was laughing delightedly at the funny
stories the night-stranded drummers were telling. He got out his tobacco sack with its meager
jingle of silver and bought the men a drink to keep them talking. He stood and grinned and
rubbed his split knuckles. And when the drummers, accepting his drink, raised their glasses and
said, “Here’s to you,” Charles was delighted. He ordered another drink for his new friends, and
then he joined them for some kind of deviltry in another place.
When Cyrus stumped out into the night he was filled with a kind of despairing anger at Charles.
He looked on the road for his son, and he went to the inn to look for him, but Charles was gone. It
is probable that if he had found him that night he would have killed him, or tried to. The direction
of a big act will warp history, but probably all acts do the same in their degree, down to a stone
stepped over in the path or a breath caught at sight of a pretty girl or a fingernail nicked in the
garden soil.
Naturally it was not long before Charles was told that his father was looking for him with a
shotgun. He hid out for two weeks, and when he finally did return, murder had sunk back to
simple anger and he paid his penalty in overwork and a false theatrical humility.
Adam lay four days in bed, so stiff and aching that he could not move without a groan. On the
third day his father gave evidence of his power with the military. He did it as a poultice to his
own pride and also as a kind of prize for Adam. Into the house, into Adam’s bedroom, came a
captain of cavalry and two sergeants in dress uniform of blue. In the dooryard their horses were
held by two privates. Lying in his bed, Adam was enlisted in the army as a private in the cavalry.
He signed the Articles of War and took the oath while his father and Alice looked on. And his
father’s eyes glis-tened with tears.
After the soldiers had gone his father sat with him a long time. “I’ve put you in the cavalry for a
reason,” he said. “Barrack life is not a good life for long. But the cavalry has work to do. I made
sure of that. You’ll like going for the Indian country. There’s action coming. I can’t tell you how
I know. There’s fighting on the way.”
“Yes, sir,” Adam said.

2
It has always seemed strange to me that it is usually men like Adam who have to do the
soldiering. He did not like fighting to start with, and far from learning to love it, as some men do,
he felt an increasing revulsion for violence. Several times his officers looked closely at him for
malingering, but no charge was brought. Dur-ing these five years of soldiering Adam did more
detail work than any man in the squadron, but if he killed any enemy it was an accident of

ricochet. Being a marksman and sharpshooter, he was peculiarly fitted to miss. By this time the
Indian fighting had become like dangerous cattle drives—the tribes were forced into revolt,
driven and decimated, and the sad, sullen rem-nants settled on starvation lands. It was not nice
work but, given the pattern of the country’s development, it had to be done.
To Adam who was an instrument, who saw not the future farms but only the torn bellies of fine
humans, it was revolting and useless. When he fired his carbine to miss he was committing
treason against his unit, and he didn’t care. The emotion of nonviolence was building in him until
it became a prejudice like any other thought-stultifying prejudice. To inflict any hurt on anything
for any purpose became inimical to him. He became ob-sessed with this emotion, for such it
surely was, until it blotted out any possible thinking in its area. But never was there any hint of
cowardice in Adam’s army record. Indeed he was commended three times and then decorated for
bravery.
As he revolted more and more from violence, his impulse took the opposite direction. He
ventured his life a number of times to bring in wounded men. He volunteered for work in field
hospitals even when he was exhausted from his regular duties. He was regarded by his comrades
with contemptuous affection and the unspoken fear men have of impulses they do not under-stand.
Charles wrote to his brother regularly—of the farm and the village, of sick cows and a foaling
mare, of the added pasture and the lightning-struck barn, of Alice’s choking death from her
consumption and his father’s move to a permanent paid position in the G.A.R. in Washington. As
with many people, Charles, who could not talk, wrote with fullness. He set down his loneliness
and his perplexities, and he put on paper many things he did not know about himself.
During the time Adam was away he knew his broth-er better than ever before or afterward. In the
exchange of letters there grew a closeness neither of them could have imagined.
Adam kept one letter from his brother, not because he understood it completely but because it
seemed to have a covered meaning he could not get at. “Dear Brother Adam,” the letter said, “I
take my pen in hand to hope you are in good health”—he always started this way to ease himself
gently into the task of writing. “I have not had your answer to my last letter but I presume you
have other things to do—ha! ha! The rain came wrong and damned the apple blossoms. There
won’t be many to eat next winter but I will save what I can. Tonight I cleaned the house, and it is
wet and soapy and maybe not any cleaner. How do you suppose Mother kept it the way she did?
It does not look the same. Something settles down on it. I don’t know what, but it will not scrub
off. But I have spread the dirt around more evenly anyways. Ha! ha!
“Did Father write you anything about his trip? He’s gone clean out to San Francisco in California
for an encampment of the Grand Army. The Secty. of War is going to be there, and Father is to
introduce him. But this is not any great shucks to Father. He has met the President three, four
times and even been to supper to the White House. I would like to see the White House. Maybe
you and me can go together when you come home. Father could put us up for a few days and he
would be wanting to see you anyways.
“I think I better look around for a wife. This is a good farm, and even if I’m no bargain there’s
girls could do worse than this farm. What do you think? You did not say if you are going to come

live home when you get out of the army. I hope so. I miss you.”
The writing stopped there. There was a scratch on the page and a splash of ink, and then it went
on in pencil, but the writing was different.
In pencil it said, “Later. Well, right there the pen gave out. One of the points broke off. I’ll have
to buy another penpoint in the village—rusted right through.”
The words began to flow more smoothly. “I guess I should wait for a new penpoint and not write
with a pencil. Only I was sitting here in the kitchen with the lamp on and I guess I got to thinking
and it come on late—after twelve, I guess, but I never looked. Old Black Joe started crowing out
in the henhouse. Then Mother’s rocking chair cricked for all the world like she was sitting in it.
You know I don’t take truck with that, but it set me minding backward, you know how you do
sometimes. I guess I’ll tear this letter up maybe, because what’s the good of writing stuff like
this.”
The words began to race now as though they couldn’t get out fast enough. “If I’m to throw it
away I’d just as well set it down,” the letter said. “It’s like the whole house was alive and had
eyes everywhere, and like there was people behind the door just ready to come in if you looked
away. It kind of makes my skin crawl. I want to say—I want to say—I mean, I never understood
—well, why our father did it. I mean, why didn’t he like that knife I bought for him on his birthday. Why didn’t he? It was a good knife and he needed a good knife. If he had used it or even
honed it, or took it out of his pocket and looked at it—that’s all he had to do. If he’d liked it I
wouldn’t have took out after you. I had to take out after you. Seems like to me my mother’s chair
is rocking a little. It’s just the light. I don’t take any truck with that. Seems like to me there’s
something not finished. Seems like when you half finished a job and can’t think what it was.
Something didn’t get done. I shouldn’t be here. I ought to be wandering around the world instead
of sitting here on a good farm looking for a wife. There is something wrong, like it didn’t get
finished, like it happened too soon and left something out. It’s me should be where you are and
you here. I never thought like this before. Maybe because it’s late—it’s later than that. I just
looked out and it’s first dawn. I don’t think I fell off to sleep. How could the night go so fast? I
can’t go to bed now. I couldn’t sleep anyways.”
The letter was not signed. Maybe Charles forgot he had intended to destroy it and sent it along.
But Adam saved it for a time, and whenever he read it again it gave him a chill and he didn’t
know why.

Chapter 5
On the ranch the little Hamiltons began to grow up, and every year there was a new one. George
was a tall handsome boy, gentle and sweet, who had from the first a kind of courtliness. Even as a
little boy he was polite and what they used to call “no trouble.” From his father he inherited the
neatness of clothing and body and hair, and he never seemed ill dressed even when he was.
George was a sinless boy and grew to be a sinless man. No crime of commission was ever
attributed to him, and his crimes of omission were only misdemea-nors. In his middle life, at
about the time such things were known about, it was discovered that he had perni-cious anemia. It
is possible that his virtue lived on a lack of energy.
Behind George, Will grew along, dumpy and stolid. Will had little imagination but he had great
energy. From childhood on he was a hard worker, if anyone would tell him what to work at, and
once told he was indefatigable. He was a conservative, not only in pol-itics but in everything.
Ideas he found revolutionary, and he avoided them with suspicion and distaste. Will liked to live
so that no one could find fault with him, and to do that he had to live as nearly like other people
as possible.
Maybe his father had something to do with Will’s distaste for either change or variation. When
Will was a growing boy, his father had not been long enough in the Salinas Valley to be thought
of as an “old-timer.” He was in fact a foreigner and an Irishman. At that time the Irish were much
disliked in America. They were looked upon with contempt, particularly on the East Coast, but a
little of it must have seeped out to the West. And Samuel had not only variability but was a man
of ideas and innovations. In small cut-off communities such a man is always regarded with
suspicion until he has proved he is no danger to the others. A shining man like Samuel could, and
can, cause a lot of trouble. He might, for example, prove too attractive to the wives of men who
knew they were dull. Then there were his education and his reading, the books he bought and
borrowed, his knowledge of things that could not be eaten or worn or cohabited with, his interest
in poetry and his respect for good writing. If Samuel had been a rich man like the Thornes or the
Delmars, with their big houses and wide flat lands, he would have had a great library.
The Delmars had a library—nothing but books in it and paneled in oak. Samuel, by borrowing,
had read many more of the Delmars’ books than the Delmars had. In that day an educated rich
man was acceptable. He might send his sons to college without comment, might wear a vest and
white shirt and tie in the daytime of a weekday, might wear gloves and keep his nails clean. And
since the lives and practices of rich men were mysterious, who knows what they could use or not
use? But a poor man—what need had he for poetry or for painting or for music not fit for singing
or dancing? Such things did not help him bring in a crop or keep a scrap of cloth on his children’s
backs. And if in spite of this he persisted, maybe he had reasons which would not stand the light
of scrutiny.

Take Samuel, for instance. He made drawings of work he intended to do with iron or wood. That
was good and understandable, even enviable. But on the edges of the plans he made other
drawings, sometimes trees, sometimes faces or animals or bugs, sometimes just figures that you
couldn’t make out at all. And these caused men to laugh with embarrassed uneasiness. Then, too,
you never knew in advance what Samuel would think or say or do—it might be anything.
The first few years after Samuel came to Salinas Valley there was a vague distrust of him. And
perhaps Will as a little boy heard talk in the San Lucas store. Little boys don’t want their fathers
to be different from other men. Will might have picked up his conservatism right then. Later, as
the other children came along and grew, Samuel belonged to the valley, and it was proud of him
in the way a man who owns a peacock is proud. They weren’t afraid of him any more, for he did
not seduce their wives or lure them out of sweet mediocri-ty. The Salinas Valley grew fond of
Samuel, but by that time Will was formed.
Certain individuals, not by any means always deserv-ing, are truly beloved of the gods. Things
come to them without their effort or planning. Will Hamilton was one of these. And the gifts he
received were the ones he could appreciate. As a growing boy Will was lucky. Just as his father
could not make money, Will could not help making it. When Will Hamilton raised chick-ens and
his hens began to lay, the price of eggs went up. As a young man, when two of his friends who
ran a little store came to the point of despondent bankruptcy, Will was asked to lend them a little
money to tide them over the quarter’s bills, and they gave him a one-third interest for a pittance.
He was not niggardly. He gave them what they asked for. The store was on its feet within one
year, expanding in two, opening branches in three, and its descendants, a great mercantile system,
now dominate a large part of the area.
Will also took over a bicycle-and-tool shop for a bad debt. Then a few rich people of the valley
bought automobiles, and his mechanic worked on them. Pres-sure was put on him by a
determined poet whose dreams were brass, cast iron, and rubber. This man’s name was Henry
Ford, and his plans were ridiculous if not illegal. Will grumblingly accepted the southern half of
the valley as his exclusive area, and within fifteen years the valley was two-deep in Fords and
Will was a rich man driving a Marmon.
Tom, the third son, was most like his father. He was born in fury and he lived in lightning. Tom
came headlong into life. He was a giant in joy and enthusi-asms. He didn’t discover the world
and its people, he created them. When he read his father’s books, he was the first. He lived in a
world shining and fresh and as uninspected as Eden on the sixth day. His mind plunged like a colt
in a happy pasture, and when later the world put up fences he plunged against the wire, and when
the final stockade surrounded him, he plunged right through it and out. And as he was capa-ble of
giant joy, so did he harbor huge sorrow, so that when his dog died the world ended.
Tom was as inventive as his father but he was bold-er. He would try things his father would not
dare. Also, he had a large concupiscence to put the spurs in his flanks, and this Samuel did not
have. Perhaps it was his driving sexual need that made him remain a bachelor. It was a very
moral family he was born into. It might be that his dreams and his longing, and his outlets for that
matter, made him feel unworthy, drove him some-times whining into the hills. Tom was a nice

mixture of savagery and gentleness. He worked inhumanly, only to lose in effort his crushing
impulses.
The Irish do have a despairing quality of gaiety, but they have also a dour and brooding ghost that
rides on their shoulders and peers in on their thoughts. Let them laugh too loudly, it sticks a long
finger down their throats. They condemn themselves before they are charged, and this makes
them defensive always.
When Tom was nine years old he worried because his pretty little sister Möllie had an
impediment in her speech. He asked her to open her mouth wide and saw that a membrane under
her tongue caused the trouble. “I can fix that,” he said. He led her to a secret place far from the
house, whetted his pocketknife on a stone, and cut the offending halter of speech. And then he ran
away and was sick.
The Hamilton house grew as the family grew. It was designed to be unfinished, so that lean-tos
could jut out as they were needed. The original room and kitchen soon disappeared in a welter of
these lean-tos.
Meanwhile Samuel got no richer. He developed a very bad patent habit, a disease many men
suffer from. He invented a part of a threshing machine, better, cheaper, and more efficient than
any in existence. The patent attorney ate up his little profit for the year. Samuel sent his models to
a manufacturer, who promptly rejected the plans and used the method. The next few years were
kept lean by the suing, and the drain stopped only when he lost the suit. It was his first sharp
experience with the rule that without money you cannot fight money. But he had caught the
patent fever, and year after year the money made by threshing and by smithing was drained off in
patents. The Hamil-ton children went barefoot, and their overalls were patched and food was
sometimes scarce, to pay for the crisp blueprints with cogs and planes and elevations.
Some men think big and some think little. Samuel and his sons Tom and Joe thought big and
George and Will thought little. Joseph was the fourth son—a kind of mooning boy, greatly
beloved and protected by the whole family. He early discovered that a smiling help-lessness was
his best protection from work. His brothers were tough hard workers, all of them. It was easier to
do Joe’s work than to make him do it. His mother and father thought him a poet because he
wasn’t any good at anything else. And they so impressed him with this that he wrote glib verses
to prove it. Joe was physically lazy, and probably mentally lazy too. He daydreamed out his life,
and his mother loved him more than the others because she thought he was helpless. Actually he
was the least helpless, because he got exactly what he wanted with a minimum of effort. Joe was
the darling of the family.
In feudal times an ineptness with sword and spear headed a young man for the church: in the
Hamilton family Joe’s inability properly to function at farm and forge headed him for a higher
education. He was not sickly or weak but he did not lift very well; he rode horses badly and
detested them. The whole family laughed with affection when they thought of Joe trying to learn
to plow; his tortuous first furrow wound about like a flatland stream, and his second furrow
touched his first only once and then to cross it and wander off.
Gradually he eliminated himself from every farm duty. His mother explained that his mind was in

the clouds, as though this were some singular virtue.
When Joe had failed at every job, his father in despair put him to herding sixty sheep. This was
the least difficult job of all and the one classically requiring no skill. All he had to do was to stay
with the sheep. And Joe lost them—lost sixty sheep and couldn’t find them where they were
huddled in the shade in a dry gulch. According to the family story, Samuel called the family
together, girls and boys, and made them promise to take care of Joe after he was gone, for if they
did not Joe would surely starve.
Interspersed with the Hamilton boys were five girls: Una the oldest, a thoughtful, studious, dark
girl; Lizzie—I guess Lizzie must have been the oldest since she was named for her mother—I
don’t know much about Lizzie. She early seemed to find a shame for her family. She married
young and went away and thereafter was seen only at funerals. Lizzie had a capacity for hatred
and bitterness unique among the Hamiltons. She had a son, and when he grew up and married a
girl Lizzie didn’t like she did not speak to him for many years.
Then there was Dessie, whose laughter was so con-stant that everyone near her was glad to be
there be-cause it was more fun to be with Dessie than with anyone else.
The next sister was Olive, my mother. And last was Mollie, who was a little beauty with lovely
blond hair and violet eyes.
These were the Hamiltons, and it was almost a mira-cle how Liza, skinny little biddy that she
was, produced them year after year and fed them, baked bread, made their clothes, and clothed
them with good manners and iron morals too.
It is amazing how Liza stamped her children. She was completely without experience in the
world, she was unread and, except for the one long trip from Ireland, untraveled. She had no
experience with men save only her husband, and that she looked upon as a tiresome and
sometimes painful duty. A good part of her life was taken up with bearing and raising. Her total
intellectual association was the Bible, except the talk of Samuel and her children, and to them she
did not listen. In that one book she had her history and her poetry, her knowledge of peoples and
things, her ethics, her morals, and her salvation. She never studied the Bible or inspected it; she
just read it. The many places where it seems to refute itself did not confuse her in the least. And
finally she came to a point where she knew it so well that she went right on reading it without
listening.
Liza enjoyed universal respect because she was a good woman and raised good children. She
could hold up her head anywhere. Her husband and her children and her grandchildren respected
her. There was a nail-hard strength in her, a lack of any compromise, a Tightness in the face of all
opposing wrongness, which made you hold her in a kind of awe but not in warmth.
Liza hated alcoholic liquors with an iron zeal. Drink-ing alcohol in any form she regarded as a
crime against a properly outraged deity. Not only would she not touch it herself, but she resisted
its enjoyment by anyone else. The result naturally was that her husband Samuel and all her
children had a good lusty love for a drink.
Once when he was very ill Samuel asked, “Liza, couldn’t I have a glass of whisky to ease me?”
She set her little hard chin. “Would you go to the throne of God with liquor on your breath? You

would not!” she said.
Samuel rolled over on his side and went about his illness without ease.
When Liza was about seventy her elimination slowed up and her doctor told her to take a
tablespoon of port wine for medicine. She forced down the first spoonful, making a crooked face,
but it was not so bad. And from that moment she never drew a completely sober breath. She
always took the wine in a tablespoon, it was always medicine, but after a time she was doing over
a quart a day and she was a much more relaxed and happy woman.
Samuel and Liza Hamilton got all of their children raised and well toward adulthood before the
turn of the century. It was a whole clot of Hamiltons growing up on the ranch to the east of King
City. And they were American children and young men and women. Samuel never went back to
Ireland and gradually he forgot it entirely. He was a busy man. He had no time for nostalgia. The
Salinas Valley was the world. A trip to Salinas sixty miles to the north at the head of the valley
was event enough for a year, and the incessant work on the ranch, the care and feeding and
clothing of his bountiful family, took most of his time—but not all. His energy was large.
His daughter Una had become a brooding student, tense and dark. He was proud of her wild,
exploring mind. Olive was preparing to take county examinations after a stretch in the secondary
school in Salinas. Olive was going to be a teacher, an honor like having a priest in the family in
Ireland. Joe was to be sent to college because he was no damn good at anything else. Will was
well along the way to accidental fortune. Tom bruised himself on the world and licked his cuts.
Dessie was studying dressmaking, and Mollie, pretty Mollie, would obviously marry some wellto-do man.
There was no question of inheritance. Although the hill ranch was large it was abysmally poor.
Samuel sunk well after well and could not find water on his own land. That would have made the
difference. Water would have made them comparatively rich. The one poor pipe of water pumped
up from deep near the house was the only source; sometimes it got dangerous-ly low, and twice it
went dry. The cattle had to come from the far fringe of the ranch to drink and then go out again to
feed.
All in all it was a good firm-grounded family, perma-nent, and successfully planted in the Salinas
Valley, not poorer than many and not richer than many either. It was a well-balanced family with
its conservatives and its radicals, its dreamers and its realists. Samuel was well pleased with the
fruit of his loins.

Chapter 6
1
After Adam joined the army and Cyrus moved to Washington, Charles lived alone on the farm.
He boasted about getting himself a wife, but he did not go about doing it by the usual process of
meeting girls, taking them to dances, testing their virtues or other-wise, and finally slipping
feebly into marriage. The truth of it was that Charles was abysmally timid of girls. And, like most
shy men, he satisfied his normal needs in the anonymity of the prostitute. There is great safety for
a shy man with a whore. Having been paid for, and in advance, she has become a commodity, and
a shy man can be gay with her and even brutal to her. Also, there is none of the horror of the
possible turn-down which shrivels the guts of timid men.
The arrangement was simple and reasonably secret. The owner of the inn kept three rooms on his
top floor for transients, which he rented to girls for two-week periods. At the end of two weeks a
new set of girls took their place. Mr. Hallam, the innkeeper, had no part in the arrangement. He
could almost say with truth that he didn’t know anything about it. He simply collected five times
the normal rent for his three rooms. The girls were assigned, procured, moved, disciplined, and
robbed by a whoremaster named Edwards, who lived in Boston. His girls moved in a slow circuit
among the small towns, never staying anywhere more than two weeks. It was an extremely
workable system. A girl was not in town long enough to cause remark either by citizen or town
marshal. They stayed pretty much in the rooms and avoided public places. They were forbid-den
on pain of beating to drink or make noise or to fall in love with anyone. Meals were served in
their rooms, and the clients were carefully screened. No drunken man was permitted to go up to
them. Every six months each girl was given one month of vacation to get drunk and raise hell. On
the job, let a girl be disobedient to the rules, and Mr. Edwards personally stripped her, gagged
her, and horsewhipped her within an inch of her life. If she did it again she found herself in jail,
charged with vagrancy and public prostitution.
The two-week stands had another advantage. Many of the girls were diseased, and a girl had
nearly always gone away by the time her gift had incubated in a client. There was no one for a
man to get mad at. Mr. Hallam knew nothing about it, and Mr. Edwards never appeared publicly
in his business capacity. He had a very good thing in his circuit.
The girls were all pretty much alike—big, healthy, lazy, and dull. A man could hardly tell there
had been a change. Charles Trask made it a habit to go to the inn at least once every two weeks,
to creep up to the top floor, do his quick business, and return to the bar to get mildly drunk.
The Trask house had never been gay, but lived in only by Charles it took on a gloomy, rustling
decay. The lace curtains were gray, the floors, although swept, grew sticky and dank. The kitchen
was lacquered—walls, windows, and ceiling—with grease from the fry-ing pans.

The constant scrubbing by the wives who had lived there and the biannual deep-seated scourging
had kept the dirt down. Charles rarely did more than sweep. He gave up sheets on his bed and
slept between blankets. What good to clean the house when there was no one to see it? Only on
the nights he went to the inn did he wash himself and put on clean clothes.
Charles developed a restlessness that got him out at dawn. He worked the farm mightily because
he was lonely. Coming in from his work, he gorged himself on fried food and went to bed and to
sleep in the resulting torpor.
His dark face took on the serious expressionlessness of a man who is nearly always alone. He
missed his brother more than he missed his mother and father. He remembered quite inaccurately
the time before Adam went away as the happy time, and he wanted it to come again.
During the years he was never sick, except of course for the chronic indigestion which was
universal, and still is, with men who live alone, cook for themselves, and eat in solitude. For this
he took a powerful purge called Father George’s Elixir of Life.
One accident he did have in the third year of his aloneness. He was digging out rocks and
sledding them to the stone wall. One large boulder was difficult to move. Charles pried at it with
a long iron bar, and the rock bucked and rolled back again and again. Suddenly he lost his
temper. The little smile came on his face, and he fought the stone as though it were a man, in
silent fury. He drove his bar deep behind it and threw his whole weight back. The bar slipped and
its upper end crashed against his forehead. For a few moments he lay unconscious in the field and
then he rolled over and staggered, half-blinded, to the house. There was a long torn welt on his
forehead from hairline to a point between his eyebrows. For a few weeks his head was bandaged
over a draining infection, but that did not worry him. In that day pus was. thought to be benign, a
proof that a wound was healing properly. When the wound did heal, it left a long and crinkled
scar, and while most scar tissue is lighter than the surrounding skin, Charles’ scar turned dark
brown. Perhaps the bar had forced iron rust under the skin and made a kind of tattoo.
The wound had not worried Charles, but the scar did. It looked like a long fingermark laid on his
fore-head. He inspected it often in the little mirror by the stove. He combed his hair down over
his forehead to conceal as much of it as he could. He conceived a shame for his scar; he hated his
scar. He became rest-less when anyone looked at it, and fury rose in him if any question was
asked about it. In a letter to his brother he put down his feeling about it.
“It looks,” he wrote, “like somebody marked me like a cow. The damn thing gets darker. By the
time you get home it will maybe be black. All I need is one going the other way and I would look
like a Papist on Ash Wednesday. I don’t know why it bothers me. I got plenty other scars. It just
seems like I was marked. And when I go into town, like to the inn, why, people are always
looking at it. I can hear them talking about it when they don’t know I can hear. I don’t know why
they’re so damn curious about it. It gets so I don’t feel like going in town at all.”

2
Adam was discharged in 1885 and started to beat his way home. In appearance he had changed
little. There was no military carriage about him. The cavalry didn’t act that way. Indeed some

units took pride in a sloppy posture.
Adam felt that he was sleepwalking. It is a hard thing to leave any deeply routined life, even if
you hate it. In the morning he awakened on a split second and lay waiting for reveille. His calves
missed the hug of leggings and his throat felt naked without its tight collar. He arrived in
Chicago, and there, for no reason, rented a furnished room for a week, stayed in it for two days,
went to Buffalo,” changed his mind, and moved to Niagara Falls. He didn’t want to go home and
he put it off as long as possible. Home was not a pleasant place in his mind. The kind of feelings
he had had there were dead in him, and he had a reluctance to bring them to life. He watched the
falls by the hour. Their roar stupefied and hypnotized him.
One evening he felt a crippling loneliness for the close men in barracks and tent. His impulse was
to rush into a crowd for warmth, any crowd. The first crowded public place he could find was a
little bar, thronged and smoky. He sighed with pleasure, almost nestled in the human clot the way
a cat nestles into a woodpile. He ordered whisky and drank it and felt warm and good. He did not
see or hear. He simply absorbed the con-tact.
As it grew late and the men began to drift away, he became fearful of the time when he would
have to go home. Soon he was alone with the bartender, who was rubbing and rubbing the
mahogany of the bar and trying with his eyes and his manner to get Adam to go.
“I’ll have one more,” Adam said.
The bartender set the bottle out. Adam noticed him for the first time. He had a strawberry mark
on his forehead.
“I’m a stranger in these parts,” said Adam.
“That’s what we mostly get at the falls,” the bartend-er said.
“I’ve been in the army. Cavalry.”
“Yeah!” the bartender said.
Adam felt suddenly that he had to impress this man, had to get under his skin some way.
“Fighting Indi-ans,” he said. “Had some great times.”
The man did not answer him.
“My brother has a mark on his head.”
The bartender touched the strawberry mark with his fingers. “Birthmark,” he said. “Gets bigger
every year. Your brother got one?”
“His came from a cut. He wrote me about it.”
“You notice this one of mine looks like a cat?”
“Sure it does.”
“That’s my nickname, Cat. Had it all my life. They say my old lady must of been scared by a cat
when she was having me.”
“I’m on my way home. Been away a long time. Won’t you have a drink?”
“Thanks. Where you staying?”
“Mrs. May’s boarding house.”
“I know her. What they tell is she fills you up with soup so you can’t eat much meat.”
“I guess there are tricks to every trade,” said Adam.

“I guess that’s right. There’s sure plenty in mine.”
“I bet that’s true,” said Adam.
“But the one trick I need I haven’t got. I wisht I knew that one.”
“What is it?”
“How the hell to get you to go home and let me close up.”
Adam stared at him, stared at him and did not speak.
“It’s a joke,” the bartender said uneasily.
“I guess I’ll go home in the morning,” said Adam. “I mean my real home.”
“Good luck,” the bartender said.
Adam walked through the dark town, increasing his speed as though his loneliness sniffed along
behind him. The sagging front steps of his boarding house creaked a warning as he climbed them.
The hall was gloomed with the dot of yellow light from an oil lamp turned down so low that it
jerked expiringly.
The landlady stood in her open doorway and her nose made a shadow to the bottom of her chin.
Her cold eyes followed Adam as do the eyes of a front-painted portrait, and she listened with her
nose for the whisky that was in him.
“Good night,” said Adam.
She did not answer him.
At the top of the first flight he looked back. Her head was raised, and now her chin made a
shadow on her throat and her eyes had no pupils.
His room smelled of dust dampened and dried many times. He picked a match from his block and
scratched it on the side of the block. He lighted the shank of candle in the japanned candlestick
and regarded the bed—as spineless as a hammock and covered with a dirty patchwork quilt, the
cotton batting spilling from the edges.
The porch steps complained again, and Adam knew the woman would be standing in her
doorway ready to spray inhospitality on the new arrival.
Adam sat down in a straight chair and put his el-bows on his knees and supported his chin in his
hands. A roomer down the hall began a patient, continuing cough against the quiet night.
And Adam knew he could not go home. He had heard old soldiers tell of doing what he was
going to do.
“I just couldn’t stand it. Didn’t have no place to go. Didn’t know nobody. Wandered around and
pretty soon I got in a panic like a kid, and first thing I knowed I’m begging the sergeant to let me
back in—like he was doing me a favor.”
Back in Chicago, Adam re-enlisted and asked to be assigned to his old regiment. On the train
going west the men of his squadron seemed very dear and desirable.
While he waited to change trains in Kansas City, he heard his name called and a message was
shoved into his hand—orders to report to Washington to the office of the Secretary of War. Adam
in his five years had absorbed rather than learned never to wonder about an order. To an enlisted
man the high far gods in Wash-ington were crazy, and if a soldier wanted to keep his sanity he
thought about generals as little as possible.

In due course Adam gave his name to a clerk and went to sit in an anteroom. His father found
him there. It took Adam a moment to recognize Cyrus, and much longer to get used to him. Cyrus
had become a great man. He dressed like a great man—black broadcloth coat and trousers, wide
black hat, overcoat with a velvet collar, ebony cane which he made to seem a sword. And Cyrus
conducted himself like a great man. His speech was slow and mellow, measured and unexcited,
his gestures were wide, and new teeth gave him a vulpine smile out of all proportion to his
emotion.
After Adam had realized that this was his father he was still puzzled. Suddenly he looked down—
no wood-en leg. The leg was straight, bent at the knee, and the foot was clad in a polished kid
congress gaiter. When he moved there was a limp, but not a clumping wood-en-legged limp.
Cyrus saw the look. “Mechanical,” he said, “Works on a hinge. Got a spring. Don’t even limp
when I set my mind to it. I’ll show it to you when I take it off. Come along with me.”
Adam said, “I’m under orders, sir. I’m to report to Colonel Wells.”
“I know you are. I told Wells to issue the orders. Come along.”
Adam said uneasily, “If you don’t mind, sir, I think I’d better report to Colonel Wells.”
His father reversed himself. “I was testing you,” he said grandly. “I wanted to see whether the
army has any discipline these days. Good boy. I knew it would be good for you. You’re a man
and a soldier, my boy.”
“I’m under orders, sir,” said Adam. This man was a stranger to him. A faint distaste arose in
Adam. Some-thing was not true. And the speed with which doors opened straight to the Colonel,
the obsequious respect of that officer, the words, “The Secretary will see you now, sir,” did not
remove Adam’s feeling.
“This is my son, a private soldier, Mr. Secretary—just as I was—a private soldier in the United
States Army.”
“I was discharged a corporal, sir,” said Adam. He hardly heard the exchange of compliments. He
was thinking, This is the Secretary of War. Can’t he see that this isn’t the way my father is? He’s
play-acting. What’s happened to him? It’s funny the Secretary can’t see it.
They walked to the small hotel where Cyrus lived, and on the way Cyrus pointed out the sights,
the build-ings, the spots of history, with the expansiveness of a lecturer. “I live in a hotel,” he
said. “I’ve thought of getting a house, but I’m on the move so much it wouldn’t hardly pay. I’m
all over the country most of the time.”
The hotel clerk couldn’t see either. He bowed to Cyrus, called him “Senator,” and indicated that
he would give Adam a room if he had to throw someone out.
“Send a bottle of whisky to my room, please.”
“I can send some chipped ice if you like.”
“Ice!” said Cyrus. “My son is a soldier.” He rapped his leg with his stick and it gave forth a
hollow sound. “I have been a soldier—a private soldier. What do we want ice for?”
Adam was amazed at Cyrus’s accommodations. He had not only a bedroom but a sitting room
beside it, and the toilet was in a closet right in the bedroom.
Cyrus sat down in a deep chair and sighed. He pulled up his trouser leg, and Adam saw the

contrap-tion of iron and leather and hard wood. Cyrus unlaced the leather sheath that held it on
his stump and stood the travesty-on-flesh beside his chair. “It gets to pinch-ing pretty bad,” he
said.
With the leg off, his father became himself again, the self Adam remembered. He had
experienced the begin-ning of contempt, but now the childhood fear and respect and animosity
came back to him, so that he seemed a little boy testing his father’s immediate mood to escape
trouble.
Cyrus made his preparations, drank his whisky, and loosened his collar. He faced Adam. “Well?”
“Sir?”
“Why did you re-enlist?”
“I—I don’t know, sir. I just wanted to.”
“You don’t like the army, Adam.”
“No, sir.”
“Why did you go back?”
“I didn’t want to go home.”
Cyrus sighed and rubbed the tips of his fingers on the arms of his chair. “Are you going to stay in
the army?” he asked.
“I don’t know, sir.”
“I can get you into West Point. I have influence. I can get you discharged so you can enter West
Point.”
“I don’t want to go there.”
“Are you defying me?” Cyrus asked quietly.
Adam took a long time to answer, and his mind sought escape before he said, “Yes, sir.”
Cyrus said, “Pour me some whisky, son,” and when he had it he continued, “I wonder if you
know how much influence I really have. I can throw the Grand Army at any candidate like a
sock. Even the President likes to know what I think about public matters. I can get senators
defeated and I can pick appointments like apples. I can make men and I can destroy men. Do you
know that?”
Adam knew more than that. He knew that Cyrus was defending himself with threats. “Yes, sir.
I’ve heard.”
“I could get you assigned to Washington—assigned to me even—teach you your way about.”
“I’d rather go back to my regiment, sir.” He saw the shadow of loss darken his father’s face.
“Maybe I made a mistake. You’ve learned the dumb resistance of a soldier.” He sighed. “I’ll get
you ordered to your regiment. You’ll rot in barracks.”
“Thank you, sir.” After a pause Adam asked, “Why don’t you bring Charles here?”
“Because I—No, Charles is better where he is—better where he is.”
Adam remembered his father’s tone and how he looked. And he had plenty of time to remember,
be-cause he did rot in barracks. He remembered that Cyrus was lonely and alone—and knew it.

Charles had looked forward to Adam’s return after five years. He had painted the house and the
barn, and as the time approached he had a woman in to clean the house, to clean it to the bone.
She was a clean, mean old woman. She looked at the dust-gray rotting curtains, threw them out,
and made new ones. She dug grease out of the stove that had been there since Charles’ mother
died. And she leached the walls of a brown shiny nastiness deposited by cooking fat and kerosene
lamps. She pickled the floors with lye, soaked the blankets in sal soda, complaining the whole
time to herself, “Men—dirty animals. Pigs is clean compared. Rot in their own juice. Don’t see
how no woman ever marries them. Stink like measles. Look at oven—pie juice from Methuselah.”
Charles had moved into a shed where his nostrils would not be assailed by the immaculate but
painful smells of lye and soda and ammonia and yellow soap. He did, however, get the
impression that she didn’t approve of his housekeeping. When finally she grum-bled away from
the shining house Charles remained in the shed. He wanted to keep the house clean for Adam. In
the shed where he slept were the tools of the farm and the tools for their repair and maintenance.
Charles found that he could cook his fried and boiled meals more quickly and efficiently on the
forge than he could on the kitchen stove. The bellows forced quick flaring heat from the coke. A
man didn’t have to wait for a stove to heat up. He wondered why he had never thought of it
before.
Charles waited for Adam, and Adam did not come. Perhaps Adam was ashamed to write. It was
Cyrus who told Charles in an angry letter about Adam’s reenlistment against his wishes. And
Cyrus indicated that, in some future, Charles could visit him in Wash-ington, but he never asked
him again.
Charles moved back to the house and lived in a kind of savage filth, taking a satisfaction in
overcoming the work of the grumbling woman.
It was over a year before Adam wrote to Charles—a letter of embarrassed newsiness building his
courage to say, “I don’t know why I signed again. It was like somebody else doing it. Write soon
and tell me how you are.”
Charles did not reply until he had received four anxious letters, and then he replied coolly, “I
didn’t hardly expect you anyway,” and he went on with a detailed account of farm and animals.
Time had got in its work. After that Charles wrote right after New Year’s and received a letter
from Adam written right after New Year’s. They had grown so apart that there was little mutual
reference and no questions.
Charles began to keep one slovenly woman after another. When they got on his nerves he threw
them out the way he would sell a pig. He didn’t like them and had no interest in whether or not
they liked him. He grew away from the village. His contacts were only with the inn and the
postmaster. The village people might denounce his manner of life, but one thing he had which
balanced his ugly life even in their eyes. The farm had never been so well run. Charles cleared
land, built up his walls, improved his drainage, and added a hundred acres to the farm. More than
that, he was planting tobacco, and a long new tobacco barn stood impressively behind the house.
For these things he kept the respect of his neighbors. A farmer cannot think too much evil of a
good farmer. Charles was spending most of his money and all of his energy on the farm.

Chapter 7

Adam spent his next five years doing the things an army uses to keep its men from going insane—
endless polishing of metal and leather, parade and drill and escort, ceremony of bugle and flag, a
ballet of business for men who aren’t doing anything. In 1886 the big packinghouse strike broke
out in Chicago and Adam’s regiment entrained, but the strike was settled before they were
needed. In 1888 the Seminóles, who had never signed a peace treaty, stirred restlessly, and the
cavalry entrained again; but the Seminóles retired into their swamps and were quiet, and the
dreamlike routine settled on the troops again.
Time interval is a strange and contradictory matter in the mind. It would be reasonable to suppose
that a routine time or an eventless time would seem intermi-nable. It should be so, but it is not. It
is the dull eventless times that have no duration whatever. A time splashed with interest,
wounded with tragedy, crevassed with joy—that’s the time that seems long in the memo-ry. And
this is right when you think about it. Eventlessness has no posts to drape duration on. From
nothing to nothing is no time at all.
Adam’s second five years were up before he knew it. It was late in 1890, and he was discharged
with ser-geant’s stripes in the Presidio in San Francisco. Letters between Charles and Adam had
become great rarities, but Adam wrote his brother just before his discharge, “This time I’m
coming home,” and that was the last Charles heard of him for over three years.
Adam waited out the winter, wandering up the river to Sacramento, ranging in the valley of the
San Joaquín, and when the spring came Adam had no money. He rolled a blanket and started
slowly east-ward, sometimes walking and sometimes with groups of men on the rods under slowmoving freight cars. At night he jungled up with wandering men in the camp-ing places on the
fringes of towns. He learned to beg, not for money but for food. And before he knew it he was a
bindlestiff himself.
Such men are rare now, but in the nineties there were many of them, wandering men, lonely men,
who wanted it that way. Some of them ran from responsibil-ities and some felt driven out of
society by injustice. They worked a little, but not for long. They stole a little, but only food and
occasionally needed garments from a wash line. They were all kinds of men—literate men and
ignorant men, clean men and dirty men—but all of them had restlessness in common. They
followed warmth and avoided great heat and great cold. As the spring advanced they tracked it
eastward, and the first frost drove them west and south. They were brothers to the coyote which,
being wild, lives close to man and his chickenyards: they were near towns but not in them.
Associations with other men were for a week or for a day and then they drifted apart.
Around the little fires where communal stew bubbled there was all manner of talk and only the

personal was unmentionable. Adam heard of the development of the I.W.W. with its angry
angels. He listened to philosophic discussions, to metaphysics, to esthetics, to impersonal
experience. His companions for the night might be a murderer, an unfrocked priest or one who
had un-frocked himself, a professor forced from his warm berth by a dull faculty, a lone driven
man running from memory, a fallen archangel and a devil in training, and each contributed bits of
thought to the fire as each contributed carrots and potatoes and onions and meat to the stew. He
learned the technique of shaving with broken glass, of judging a house before knocking to ask for
a handout. He learned to avoid or get along with hostile police and to evaluate a woman for her
warmth of heart.
Adam took pleasure in the new life. When autumn touched the trees he had got as far as Omaha,
and without question or reason or thought he hurried west and south, fled through the mountains
and arrived with relief in Southern California. He wandered by the sea from the border north as
far as San Luis Obispo, and he learned to pilfer the tide pools for abalones and eels and mussels
and perch, to dig the sandbars for clams, and to trap a rabbit in the dunes with a noose of fishline.
And he lay in the sun-warmed sand, counting the waves.
Spring urged him east again, but more slowly than before. Summer was cool in the mountains,
and the mountain people were kind as lonesome people are kind. Adam took a job on a widow’s
outfit near Denver and shared her table and her bed humbly until the frost drove him south again.
He followed the Rio Grande past Albuquerque and El Paso through the Big Bend, through
Laredo to Brownsville. He learned Spanish words for food and pleasure, and he learned that
when people are very poor they still have something to give and the impulse to give it. He
developed a love for poor people he could not have conceived if he had not been poor himself.
And by now he was an expert tramp, using humility as a working principle. He was lean and sundarkened, and he could withdraw his own person-ality until he made no Stir of anger or jealousy.
His voice had grown soft, and he had merged many accents and dialects into his own speech, so
that his speech did not seem foreign anywhere. This was the great safety of the tramp, a
protective veil. He rode the trains very infrequently, for there was a growing anger against
tramps, based on the angry violence of the I.W.W. and aggravated by the fierce reprisals against
them. Adam was picked up for vagrancy. The quick brutality of police and prisoners frightened
him and drove him away from the gatherings of tramps. He traveled alone after that and made
sure that he was shaven and clean.
When spring came again he started north. He felt that his time of rest and peace was over. He
aimed north toward Charles and the weakening memories of his childhood.
Adam moved rapidly across interminable East Tex-as, through Louisiana and the butt ends of
Mississippi and Alabama, and into the flank of Florida. He felt that he had to move quickly. The
Negroes were poor enough to be kind, but they could not trust any white man no matter how
poor, and the poor white men had a fear of strangers.
Near Tallahassee he was picked up by sheriff’s men, judged vagrant, and put on a road gang.
That’s how the roads were built. His sentence was six months. He was released and instantly
picked up again for a second six months. And now he learned how men can consider other men

as beasts and that the easiest way to get along with such men was to be a beast. A clean face, an
open face, an eye raised to meet an eye—these drew attention and attention drawn brought
punishment. Adam thought how a man doing an ugly or a brutal thing has hurt himself and must
punish someone for the hurt. To be guarded at work by men with shotguns, to be shackled by the
ankle at night to a chain, were simple matters of precaution, but the savage whippings for the
least stir of will, for the smallest shred of dignity or resistance, these seemed to indicate that
guards were afraid of prisoners, and Adam knew from his years in the army that a man afraid is a
dangerous animal. And Adam, like anyone in the world, feared what whipping would do to his
body and his spirit. He drew a curtain around himself. He removed expression from his face, light
from his eyes, and silenced his speech. Later he was not so much astonished that it had happened
to him but that he had been able to take it and with a minimum of pain. It was much more
horrible afterward than when it was happening. It is a triumph of self-control to see a man
whipped until the muscles of his back show white and glistening through the cuts and to give no
sign of pity or anger or interest. And Adam learned this.
People are felt rather than seen after the first few moments. During his second sentence on the
roads of Florida, Adam reduced his personality to a minus. He caused no stir, put out no
vibration, became as nearly invisible as it is possible to be. And when the guards could not feel
him, they were not afraid of him. They gave him the jobs of cleaning the camps, of handing out
the slops to the prisoners, of filling the water buck-ets.
Adam waited until three days before his second re-lease. Right after noon that day he filled the
water buckets and went back to the little river for more. He filled his buckets with stones and
sank them, and then he eased himself into the water and swam a long way downstream, rested
and swam farther down. He kept moving in the water until at dusk he found a place under a bank
with bushes for cover. He did not get out of the water.
Late in the night he heard the hounds go by, cover-ing both sides of the river. He had rubbed his
hair hard with green leaves to cover human odor. He sat in the water with his nose and eyes clear.
In the morning the hounds came back, disinterested, and the men were too tired to beat the banks
properly. When they were gone Adam dug a piece of water-logged fried sowbelly out of his
pocket and ate it.
He had schooled himself against hurry. Most men were caught bolting. It took Adam five days to
cross the short distance into Georgia. He took no chances, held back his impatience with an iron
control. He was astonished at his ability.
On the edge of Valdosta, Georgia, he lay hidden until long after midnight, and he entered the
town like a shadow, crept to the rear of a cheap store, forced a window slowly so that the screws
of the lock were pulled from the sun-rotted wood. Then he replaced the lock but left the window
open. He had to work by moonlight drifting through dirty windows. He stole a pair of cheap
trousers, a white shirt, black shoes, black hat, and an oilskin raincoat, and he tried on each article
for fit. He forced himself to make sure nothing looked disturbed before he climbed out the
window. He had taken nothing which was not heavily stocked. He had not even looked for the
cash drawer. He lowered the window carefully and slipped from shadow to shadow in the

moonlight.
He lay hidden during the day and went in search of food at night—turnips, a few ears of corn
from a crib, a few windfall apples—nothing that would be missed. He broke the newness of the
shoes with rubbed sand and kneaded the raincoat to destroy its newness. It was three days before
he got the rain he needed, or in his extreme caution felt he needed.
The rain started late in the afternoon. Adam huddled under his oilskin, waiting for the dark to
come, and when it did he walked through the dripping night into the town of Valdosta. His black
hat was pulled down over his eyes and his yellow oilskin was strapped tight against his throat. He
made his way to the station and peered through a rain-blurred window. The station agent, in green
eyeshade and black alpaca worksleeves, leaned through the ticket window, talking to a friend. It
was twenty minutes before the friend went away. Adam watched him off the platform. He took a
deep breath to calm himself and went inside.

Charles received very few letters. Sometimes he did not inquire at the post office for weeks. In
February of 1894 when a thick letter came from a firm of attorneys in Washington the postmaster
thought it might be im-portant. He walked out to the Trask farm, found Charles cutting wood, and
gave him the letter. And since he had taken so much trouble, he waited around to hear what the
letter said.
Charles let him wait. Very slowly he read all five pages, went back and read them again, moving
his lips over the words. Then he folded it up and turned toward the house.
The postmaster called after him, “Anything wrong, Mr. Trask?”
“My father is dead,” Charles said, and he walked into the house and closed the door.
“Took it hard,” the postmaster reported in town. “Took it real hard. Quiet man. Don’t talk much.”
In the house Charles lighted the lamp although it was not dark yet. He laid the letter on the table,
and he washed his hands before he sat down to read it again.
There hadn’t been anyone to send him a telegram. The attorneys had found his address among his
father’s papers. They were sorry—offered their condolences. And they were pretty excited too.
When they had made Trask’s will they thought he might have a few hundred dollars to leave his
sons. That is what he looked to be worth. When they inspected his bankbooks they found that he
had over ninety-three thousand dollars in the bank and ten thousand dollars in good securities.
They felt very different about Mr. Trask then. People with that much money were rich. They
would never have to worry. It was enough to start a dynasty. The lawyers congratulated Charles
and his brother Adam. Under the will, they said, it was to be shared equally. After the money they
listed the personal effects left by the deceased: five ceremonial swords presented to Cyrus at
various G.A.R. conventions, an olive wood gavel with a gold plate on it, a Masonic watch charm
with a dia-mond set in the dividers, the gold caps from the teeth he had out when he got his
plates, watch (silver), gold-headed stick, and so forth.
Charles read the letter twice more and cupped his forehead in his hands. He wondered about
Adam. He wanted Adam home.

Charles felt puzzled and dull. He built up the fire and put the frying pan to heat and sliced thick
pieces of salt pork into it. Then he went back to stare at the letter. Suddenly he picked it up and
put it in the drawer of the kitchen table. He decided not to think of the matter at all for a while.
Of course he thought of little else, but it was a dull circular thinking that came back to the starting
point again and again: Where had he gotten it?
When two events have something in common, in their natures or in time or place, we leap happily
to the conclusion that they are similar and from this tendency we create magics and store them for
retelling. Charles had never before had a letter delivered at the farm in his life. Some weeks later
a boy ran out to the farm with a telegram. Charles always connected the letter and the telegram
the way we group two deaths and anticipate a third. He hurried to the village railroad station,
carrying the telegram in his hand.
“Listen to this,” he said to the operator.
“I already read it.”
“You did?”
“It comes over the wire,” said the operator. “I wrote it down.”
“Oh! Yes, sure. ‘Urgent need you telegraph me one hundred dollars. Coming home. Adam.’ ”
“Came collect,” the operator said. “You owe me sixty cents.”
“Valdosta, Georgia—I never heard of it.”
“Neither’d I, but it’s there.”
“Say, Carlton, how do you go about telegraphing money?”
“Well, you bring me a hundred and two dollars and sixty cents and I send a wire telling the
Valdosta opera-tor to pay Adam one hundred dollars. You owe me sixty cents too.”
“I’ll pay—say, how do I know it’s Adam? What’s to stop anybody from collecting it?”
The operator permitted himself a smile of worldliness. “Way we go about it, you give me a
question couldn’t nobody else know the answer. So I send both the question and the answer.
Operator asks this fella the question, and if he can’t answer he don’t get the money.”
“Say, that’s pretty cute. I better think up a good one.”
“You better get the hundred dollars while Old Breen still got the window open.”
Charles was delighted with the game. He came back with the money in his hand. “I got the
question,” he said.
“I hope it ain’t your mother’s middle name. Lot of people don’t remember.”
“No, nothing like that. It’s this. ‘What did you give Father on his birthday just before you went in
the army?’ ”
“It’s a good question but it’s long as hell. Can’t you cut it down to ten words?”
“Who’s paying for it? Answer is, ‘A pup.’ ”
“Wouldn’t nobody guess that,” said Carlton. “Well, it’s you paying, not me.”
“Be funny if he forgot,” said Charles. “He wouldn’t ever get home.”

Adam came walking out from the village. His shirt was dirty and the stolen clothes were wrinkled

and soiled from having been slept in for a week. Between the house and the barn he stopped and
listened for his brother, and in a moment he heard him hammering at something in the big new
tobacco barn. “Oh, Charles!” Adam called.
The hammering stopped, and there was silence. Adam felt as though his brother were inspecting
him through the cracks in the barn. Then Charles came out quickly and hurried to Adam and
shook hands.
“How are you?”
“Fine,” said Adam.
“Good God, you’re thin!”
“I guess I am. And I’m years older too.”
Charles inspected him from head to foot. “You don’t look prosperous.”
“I’m not.”
“Where’s your valise?”
“I haven’t got one.”
“Jesus Christ! Where’ve you been?”
“Mostly wandering around all over.”
“Like a hobo?”
“Like a hobo.”
After all the years and the life that had made creased leather out of Charles’ skin and redness in
his dark eyes, Adam knew from remembering that Charles was thinking of two things—the
questions and something else.
“Why didn’t you come home?”
“I just got to wandering. Couldn’t stop. It gets into you. That’s a real bad scar you’ve got there.”
“That’s the one I wrote you about. Gets worse all the time. Why didn’t you write? Are you
hungry?” Charles’ hands itched into his pockets and out and touched his chin and scratched his
head.
“It may go away. I saw a man once—bartender—he had one that looked like a cat. It was a
birthmark. His nickname was Cat.”
“Are you hungry?”
“Sure, I guess I am.”
“Plan to stay home now?”
“I—I guess so. Do you want to get to it now?”
“I—I guess so,” Charles echoed him. “Our father is dead.”
“I know.”
“How the hell do you know?”
“Station agent told me. How long ago did he die?”
“ ’Bout a month.”
“What of?”
“Pneumonia.”
“Buried here?”

“No. In Washington. I got a letter and newspapers. Carried him on a caisson with a flag over it.
The Vice-President was there and the President sent a wreath. All in the papers. Pictures too—I’ll
show you. I’ve got it all.”
Adam studied his brother’s face until Charles looked away. “Are you mad at something?” Adam
asked.
“What should I be mad at?”
“It just sounded—”
“I’ve got nothing to be mad at. Come on, I’ll get you something to eat.”
“All right. Did he linger long?”
“No. It was galloping pneumonia. Went right out.”
Charles was covering up something. He wanted to tell it but he didn’t know how to go about it.
He kept hiding in words. Adam fell silent. It might be a good thing to be quiet and let Charles
sniff and circle until he came out with it.
“I don’t take much stock in messages from the be-yond,” said Charles. “Still, how can you know?
Some people claim they’ve had messages—old Sarah Whitburn. She swore. You just don’t know
what to think. You didn’t get a message, did you? Say, what the hell’s bit off your tongue?”
Adam said, “Just thinking.” And he was thinking with amazement, Why, I’m not afraid of my
brother! I used to be scared to death of him, and I’m not any more. Wonder why not? Could it be
the army? Or the chain gang? Could it be Father’s death? Maybe—but I don’t understand it. With
the lack of fear, he knew he could say anything he wanted to, whereas before he had picked over
his words to avoid trouble. It was a good feeling he had, almost as though he himself had been
dead and resurrected.
They walked into the kitchen he remembered and didn’t remember. It seemed smaller and
dingier. Adam said almost gaily, “Charles, I been listening. You want to tell me something and
you’re walking around it like a terrier around a bush. You better tell before it bites you.”
Charles’ eyes sparked up with anger. He raised his head. His force was gone. He thought with
desolation, I can’t lick him any more. I can’t.
Adam chuckled. “Maybe it’s wrong to feel good when our father’s just died, but you know,
Charles, I never felt better in my whole life. I never felt as good. Spill it, Charles. Don’t let it
chew on you.”
Charles asked, “Did you love our father?”
“I won’t answer you until I know what you’re getting at.”
“Did you or didn’t you?”
“What’s that got to do with you?”
“Tell me.”
The creative free boldness was all through Adam’s bones and brain. “All right, I’ll tell you. No. I
didn’t. Sometimes he scared me. Sometimes—yes, sometimes I admired him, but most of the
time I hated him. Now tell me why you want to know.”
Charles was looking down at his hands. “I don’t understand,” he said. “I just can’t get it through
my head. He loved you more than anything in the world.”

“I don’t believe that.”
“You don’t have to. He liked everything you brought him. He didn’t like me. He didn’t like
anything I gave him. Remember the present I gave him, the pocketknife? I cut and sold a load of
wood to get that knife. Well, he didn’t even take it to Washington with him. It’s right in his
bureau right now. And you gave him a pup. It didn’t cost you a thing. Well, I’ll show you a
picture of that pup. It was at his funeral. A colonel was holding it—it was blind, couldn’t walk.
They shot it after the funeral.”
Adam was puzzled at the fierceness of his brother’s tone. “I don’t see,” he said. “I don’t see what
you’re getting at.”
“I loved him,” said Charles. And for the first time that Adam could remember, Charles began to
cry. He put his head down in his arms and cried.
Adam was about to go to him when a little of the old fear came back. No, he thought, if I touched
him he would try to kill me. He went to the open doorway and stood looking out, and he could
hear his brother’s sniffling behind him.
It was not a pretty farm near the house—never had been. There was litter about it, an
unkemptness, a rundownness, a lack of plan; no flowers, and bits of paper and scraps of wood
scattered about on the ground. The house was not pretty either. It was a well-built shanty for
shelter and cooking. It was a grim farm and a grim house, unloved and unloving. It was no home,
no place to long for or to come back to. Suddenly Adam thought of his stepmother—as unloved
as the farm, adequate, clean in her way, but no more wife than the farm was a home.
His brother’s sobbing had stopped. Adam turned. Charles was looking blankly straight ahead.
Adam said, “Tell me about Mother.”
“She died. I wrote you.”
“Tell me about her.”
“I told you. She died. It’s so long ago. She wasn’t your mother.”
The smile Adam had once caught on her face flashed up in his mind. Her face was projected in
front of him.
Charles’ voice came through the image and exploded it. “Will you tell me one thing—not quick—
think be-fore you tell me, and maybe don’t answer unless it’s true, your answer.”
Charles moved his lips to form the question in ad-vance. “Do you think it would be possible for
our father to be—dishonest?”
“What do you mean?”
“Isn’t that plain enough? I said it plain. There’s only one meaning to dishonest.”
“I don’t know,” said Adam. “I don’t know. No one ever said it. Look what he got to be. Stayed
overnight in the White House. The Vice-President came to his funeral. Does that sound like a
dishonest man? Come on, Charles,” he begged, “tell me what you’ve been wanting to tell me
from the minute I got here.”
Charles wet his lips. The blood seemed to have gone out of him, and with it energy and all
ferocity. His voice became a monotone. “Father made a will. Left everything equal to me and
you.”

Adam laughed. “Well, we can always live on the farm. I guess we won’t starve.”
“It’s over a hundred thousand dollars,” the dull voice went on.
“You’re crazy. More like a hundred dollars. Where would he get it?”
“It’s no mistake. His salary with the G.A.R. was a hundred and thirty-five dollars a month. He
paid his own room and board. He got five cents a mile and hotel expenses when he traveled.”
“Maybe he had it all the time and we never knew.”
“No, he didn’t have it all the time.”
“Well, why don’t we write to the G.A.R. and ask? Someone there might know.”
“I wouldn’t dare,” said Charles.
“Now look! Don’t go off half-cocked. There’s such a thing as speculation. Lots of men struck it
rich. He knew big men. Maybe he got in on a good thing. Think of the men who went to the gold
rush in California and came back rich.”
Charles’ face was desolate. His voice dropped so that Adam had to lean close to hear. It was as
toneless as a report. “Our father went into the Union Army in June 1862. He had three months’
training here in this state. That makes it September. He marched south. October twelfth he was
hit in the leg and sent to the hospital. He came home in January.”
“I don’t see what you’re getting at.”
Charles’ words were thin and sallow. “He was not at Chancellorsville. He was not at Gettysburg
or the Wil-derness or Richmond or Appomattox.”
“How do you know?”
“His discharge. It came down with his other papers.”
Adam sighed deeply. In his chest, like beating fists, was a surge of joy. He shook his head almost
in disbe-lief.
Charles said, “How did he get away with it? How in hell did he get away with it? Nobody ever
questioned it. Did you? Did I? Did my mother? Nobody did. Not even in Washington.”
Adam stood up. “What’s in the house to eat? I’m going to warm up something.”
“I killed a chicken last night. I’ll fry it if you can wait.”
“Anything quick?”
“Some salt pork and plenty of eggs.”
“I’ll have that,” said Adam.
They left the question lying there, walked mentally around it, stepped over it. Their words
ignored it but their minds never left it. They wanted to talk about it and could not. Charles fried
salt pork, warmed up a skillet of beans, fried eggs.
“I plowed the pasture,” he said. “Put it in rye.”
“How did it do?”
“Just fine, once I got the rocks out.” He touched his forehead. “I got this damn thing trying to pry
out a stone.”
“You wrote about that,” Adam said. “Don’t know whether I told you your letters meant a lot to
me.”
“You never wrote much what you were doing,” said Charles.

“I guess I didn’t want to think about it. It was pretty bad, most of it.”
“I read about the campaigns in the papers. Did you go on those?”
“Yes. I didn’t want to think about them. Still don’t.”
“Did you kill Injuns?”
“Yes, we killed Injuns.”
“I guess they’re real ornery.”
“I guess so.”
“You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.”
“I don’t want to.”
They ate their dinner under the kerosene lamp. “We’d get more light if I would only get around to
washing that lampshade.”
“I’ll do it,” said Adam. “It’s hard to think of every-thing.”
“It’s going to be fine having you back. How would you like to go to the inn after supper?”
“Well, we’ll see. Maybe I’d like just to sit awhile.”
“I didn’t write about it in a letter, but they’ve got girls at the inn. I didn’t know but you’d like to
go in with me. They change every two weeks. I didn’t know but you’d like to look them over.”
“Girls?”
“Yes, they’re upstairs. Makes it pretty handy. And I thought you just coming home—”
“Not tonight. Maybe later. How much do they charge?”
“A dollar. Pretty nice girls mostly.”
“Maybe later,” said Adam. “I’m surprised they let them come in.”
“I was too at first. But they worked out a system.”
“You go often?”
“Every two or three weeks. It’s pretty lonesome here, a man living alone.”
“You wrote once you were thinking of getting mar-ried.”
“Well, I was. Guess I didn’t find the right girl.”
All around the main subject the brothers beat. Now and then they would almost step into it, and
quickly pull away, back into crops and local gossip and politics and health. They knew they
would come back to it sooner or later. Charles was more anxious to strike in deep than Adam
was, but then Charles had had the time to think of it, and to Adam it was a new field of thinking
and feeling. He would have preferred to put it over until another day, and at the same time he
knew his brother would not permit him to.
Once he said openly, “Let’s sleep on that other thing.”
“Sure, if you want to,” said Charles.
Gradually they ran out of escape talk. Every ac-quaintance was covered and every local event.
The talk lagged and the time went on.
“Feel like turning in?” Adam asked.
“In a little while.”
They were silent, and the night moved restlessly about the house, nudging them and urging them.
“I sure would like to’ve seen that funeral,” said Charles.

“Must have been pretty fancy.”
“Would you care to see the clippings from the pa-pers? I’ve got them all in my room.”
“No. Not tonight.”
Charles squared his chair around and put his elbows on the table. “We’ll have to figure it out,” he
said nervously. “We can put it off all we want, but we goddam well got to figure what we’re
going to do.”
“I know that,” said Adam. “I guess I just wanted some time to think about it.”
“Would that do any good? I’ve had time, lots of time, and I just went in circles. I tried not to
think about it, and I still went in circles. You think time is going to help?”
“I guess not. I guess not. What do you want to talk about first? I guess we might as well get into
it. We’re not thinking about anything else.”
“There’s the money,” said Charles. “Over a hundred thousand dollars—a fortune.”
“What about the money?”
“Well, where did it come from?”
“How do I know? I told you he might have specu-lated. Somebody might have put him onto a
good thing there in Washington.”
“Do you believe that?”
“I don’t believe anything,” Adam said. “I don’t know, so what can I believe?”
“It’s a lot of money,” said Charles. “It’s a fortune left to us. We can live the rest of our lives on it,
or we can buy a hell of a lot of land and make it pay. Maybe you didn’t think about it, but we’re
rich. We’re richer than anybody hereabouts.”
Adam laughed. “You say it like it was a jail sen-tence.”
“Where did it come from?”
“What do you care?” Adam asked. “Maybe we should just settle back and enjoy it.”
“He wasn’t at Gettysburg. He wasn’t at any goddam battle in the whole war. He was hit in a
skirmish. Everything he told was lies.”
“What are you getting at?” said Adam.
“I think he stole the money,” Charles said miserably. “You asked me and that’s what I think.”
“Do you know where he stole it?”
“No.”
“Then why do you think he stole it?”
“He told lies about the war.”
“What?”
“I mean, if he lied about the war—why, he could steal.”
“How?”
“He held jobs in the G.A.R.—big jobs. He maybe could have got into the treasury, rigged the
books.”
Adam sighed. “Well, if that’s what you think, why don’t you write to them and tell them? Have
them go over the books. If it’s true we could give back the money.”
Charles’ face was twisted and the scar on his fore-head showed dark. “The Vice-President came

to his funeral. The President sent a wreath. There was a line of carriages half a mile long and
hundreds of people on foot. And do you know who the pall bearers were?”
“What are you digging at?”
“ ’Spose we found out he’s a thief. Then it would come out how he never was at Gettysburg or
anyplace else. Then everybody would know he was a liar too, and his whole life was a goddam
lie. Then even if sometimes he did tell the truth, nobody would believe it was the truth.”
Adam sat very still. His eyes were untroubled but he was watchful. “I thought you loved him,” he
said calm-ly. He felt released and free.
“I did. I do. That’s why I hate this—his whole life gone—all gone. And his grave—they might
even dig him up and throw him out.” His words were ragged with emotion. “Didn’t you love him
at all?” he cried.
“I wasn’t sure until now,” said Adam. “I was all mixed up with how I was supposed to feel. No. I
did not love him.”
“Then you don’t care if his life is spoiled and his poor body rooted up and—oh, my God
almighty!”
Adam’s brain raced, trying to find words for his feeling. “I don’t have to care.”
“No, you don’t,” Charles said bitterly. “Not if you didn’t love him, you don’t. You can help kick
him in the face.”
Adam knew that his brother was no longer danger-ous. There was no jealousy to drive him. The
whole weight of his father was on him, but it was his father and no one could take his father away
from him.
“How will you feel, walking in town, after everyone knows?” Charles demanded. “How will you
face any-body?”
“I told you I don’t care. I don’t have to care because I don’t believe it.”
“You don’t believe what?”
“I don’t believe he stole any money. I believe in the war he did just what he said he did and was
just where he said he was.”
“But the proof—how about the discharge?”
“You haven’t any proof that he stole. You just made that up because you don’t know where the
money came from.”
“His army papers—”
“They could be wrong,” Adam said. “I believe they are wrong. I believe in my father.”
“I don’t see how you can.”
Adam said, “Let me tell you. The proofs that God does not exist are very strong, but in lots of
people they are not as strong as the feeling that He does.”
“But you said you did not love our father. How can you have faith in him if you didn’t love him?”
“Maybe that’s the reason,” Adam said slowly, feeling his way. “Maybe if I had loved him I
would have been jealous of him. You were. Maybe—maybe love makes you suspicious and
doubting. Is it true that when you love a woman you are never sure—never sure of her because
you aren’t sure of yourself? I can see it pretty clearly. I can see how you loved him and what it

did to you. I did not love him. Maybe he loved me. He tested me and hurt me and punished me
and finally he sent me out like a sacrifice, maybe to make up for some-thing. But he did not love
you, and so he had faith in you. Maybe—why, maybe it’s a kind of reverse.”
Charles stared at him. “I don’t understand,” he said.
“I’m trying to,” said Adam. “It’s a new thought to me. I feel good. I feel better maybe than I have
ever felt in my whole life. I’ve got rid of something. Maybe sometime I’ll get what you have, but
I haven’t got it now.”
“I don’t understand,” Charles said again.
“Can you see that I don’t think our father was a thief? I don’t believe he was a liar.”
“But the papers—”
“I won’t look at the papers. Papers are no match at all for my faith in my father.”
Charles was breathing heavily. “Then you would take the money?”
“Of course.”
“Even if he stole it?”
“He did not steal it. He couldn’t have stolen it.”
“I don’t understand,” said Charles.
“You don’t? Well, it does seem that maybe this might be the secret of the whole thing. Look, I’ve
never mentioned this—do you remember when you beat me up just before I went away?”
“Yes.”
“Do you remember later? You came back with a hatchet to kill me.”
“I don’t remember very well. I must have been crazy.”
“I didn’t know then, but I know now—you were fighting for your love.”
“Love?”
“Yes,” said Adam. “We’ll use the money well. Maybe we’ll stay here. Maybe we’ll go away—
maybe to California. We’ll have to see what we’ll do. And of course we must set up a monument
to our father—a big one.”
“I couldn’t ever go away from here,” said Charles.
“Well, let’s see how it goes, There’s no hurry. We’ll feel it out.”

Chapter 8
1
I believe there are monsters born in the world to hu-man parents. Some you can see, misshapen
and horri-ble, with huge heads or tiny bodies; some are born with no arms, no legs, some with
three arms, some with tails or mouths in odd places. They are accidents and no one’s fault, as
used to be thought. Once they were considered the visible punishment for concealed sins.
And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born? The
face and body may be perfect, but if a twisted gene or a mal-formed egg can produce physical
monsters, may not the same process produce a malformed soul?
Monsters are variations from the accepted normal to a greater or a less degree. As a child may be
born with-out an arm, so one may be born without kindness or the potential of conscience. A man
who loses his arms in an accident has a great struggle to adjust himself to the lack, but one born
without arms suffers only from people who find him strange. Having never had arms, he cannot
miss them. Sometimes when we are little we imagine how it would be to have wings, but there is
no reason to suppose it is the same feeling birds have. No, to a monster the norm must seem
monstrous, since everyone is normal to himself. To the inner monster it must be even more
obscure, since he has no visible thing to compare with others. To a man born without conscience,
a soul-stricken man must seem ridiculous. To a criminal, honesty is foolish. You must not forget
that a monster is only a variation, and that to a mon-ster the norm is monstrous.
It is my belief that Cathy Ames was born with the tendencies, or lack of them, which drove and
forced her all of her life. Some balance wheel was misweighted, some gear out of ratio. She was
not like other people, never was from birth. And just as a cripple may learn to utilize his lack so
that he becomes more effective in a limited field than the uncrippled, so did Cathy, using her
difference, make a painful and bewildering stir in her world.
There was a time when a girl like Cathy would have been called possessed by the devil. She
would have been exorcised to cast out the evil spirit, and if after many trials that did not work,
she would have been burned as a witch for the good of the community. The one thing that may
not be forgiven a witch is her ability to distress people, to make them restless and uneasy and
even envious.
As though nature concealed a trap, Cathy had from the first a face of innocence. Her hair was
gold and lovely; wide-set hazel eyes with upper lids that drooped made her look mysteriously
sleepy. Her nose was deli-cate and thin, and her cheekbones high and wide, sweeping down to a
small chin so that her face was heart-shaped. Her mouth was well shaped and well lipped but
abnormally small—what used to be called a rosebud. Her ears were very little, without lobes, and
they pressed so close to her head that even with her hair combed up they made no silhouette.

They were thin flaps sealed against her head.
Cathy always had a child’s figure even after she was grown, slender, delicate arms and hands—
tiny hands. Her breasts never developed very much. Before her puberty the nipples turned
inward. Her mother had to manipulate them out when they became painful in Cathy’s tenth year.
Her body was a boy’s body, nar-row-hipped, straight-legged, but her ankles were thin and
straight without being slender. Her feet were small and round and stubby, with fat insteps almost
like little hoofs. She was a pretty child and she became a pretty woman. Her voice was huskily
soft, and it could be so sweet as to be irresistible. But there must have been some steel cord in her
throat, for Cathy’s voice could cut like a file when she wished.
Even as a child she had some quality that made people look at her, then look away, then look
back at her, troubled at something foreign. Something looked out of her eyes, and was never there
when one looked again. She moved quietly and talked little, but she could enter no room without
causing everyone to turn toward her.
She made people uneasy but not so that they wanted to go away from her. Men and women
wanted to inspect her, to be close to her, to try to find what caused the disturbance she distributed
so subtly. And since this had always been so, Cathy did not find it strange.
Cathy was different from other children in many ways, but one thing in particular set her apart.
Most children abhor difference. They want to look, talk, dress, and act exactly like all of the
others. If the style of dress is an absurdity, it is pain and sorrow to a child not to wear that
absurdity. If necklaces of pork chops were accepted, it would be a sad child who could not wear
pork chops. And this slavishness to the group normally extends into every game, every practice,
so-cial or otherwise. It is a protective coloration children utilize for their safety.
Cathy had none of this. She never conformed in dress or conduct. She “wore whatever she
wanted to. The result was that quite often other children imitated her.
As she grew older the group, the herd, which is any collection of children, began to sense what
adults felt, that there was something foreign about Cathy. After a while only one person at a time
associated with her. Groups of boys and girls avoided her as though she carried a nameless
danger.
Cathy was a liar, but she did not lie the way most children do. Hers was no daydream lying, when
the thing imagined is told and, to make it seem more real, told as real. That is just ordinary
deviation from exter-nal reality. I think the difference between a lie and a story is that a story
utilizes the trappings and appear-ance of truth for the interest of the listener as well as of the
teller. A story has in it neither gain nor loss. But a lie is a device for profit or escape. I suppose if
that definition is strictly held to, then a writer of stories is a liar—if he is financially fortunate.
Cathy’s lies were never innocent. Their purpose was to escape punishment, or work, or
responsibility, and they were used for profit. Most liars are tripped up either because they forget
what they have told or be-cause the lie is suddenly faced with an incontrovertible truth. But Cathy
did not forget her lies, and she de-veloped the most effective method of lying. She stayed close
enough to the truth so that one could never be sure. She knew two other methods also—either to
inter-lard her lies with truth or to tell a truth as though it were a lie. If one is accused of a lie and

it turns out to be the truth, there is a backlog that will last a long time and protect a number of
untruths.
Since Cathy was an only child her mother had no close contrast in the family. She thought all
children were like her own. And since all parents are worriers she was convinced that all her
friends had the same problems.
Cathy’s father was not so sure. He operated a small tannery in a town in Massachusetts, which
made a comfortable, careful living if he worked very hard. Mr. Ames came in contact with other
children away from his home and he felt that Cathy was not like other children. It was a matter
more felt than known. He was uneasy about his daughter but he could not have said why.
Nearly everyone in the world has appetites and im-pulses, trigger emotions, islands of
selfishness, lusts just beneath the surface. And most people either hold such things in check or
indulge them secretly. Cathy knew not only these impulses in others but how to use them for her
own gain. It is quite possible that she did not believe in any other tendencies in humans, for while
she was preternaturally alert in some directions she was completely blind in others.
Cathy learned when she was very young that sexuali-ty with all its attendant yearnings and pains,
jealousies and taboos, is the most disturbing impulse humans have. And in that day it was even
more disturbing than it is now, because the subject was unmentionable and unmentioned.
Everyone concealed that little hell in himself, while publicly pretending it did not exist—and
when he was caught up in it he was completely help-less. Cathy learned that by the manipulation
and use of this one part of people she could gain and keep power over nearly everyone. It was at
once a weapon and a threat. It was irresistible. And since the blind helpless-ness seems never to
have fallen on Cathy, it is probable that she had very little of the impulse herself and indeed felt a
contempt for those who did. And when you think of it in one way, she was right.
What freedom men and women could have, were they not constantly tricked and trapped and
enslaved and tortured by their sexuality! The only drawback in that freedom is that without it one
would not be a human. One would be a monster.
At ten Cathy knew something of the power of the sex impulse and began coldly to experiment
with it. She planned everything coldly, foreseeing difficulties and preparing for them.
The sex play of children has always gone on. Every-one, I guess, who is not abnormal has
foregathered with little girls in some dim leafy place, in the bottom of a manger, under a willow,
in a culvert under a road—or at least has dreamed of doing so. Nearly all parents are faced with
the problem sooner or later, and then the child is lucky if the parent remembers his own childhood. In the time of Cathy’s childhood, however, it was harder. The parents, denying it in
themselves, were horrified to find it in their children.

2
On a spring morning when with late-surviving dew the young grass bristled under the sun, when
the warmth crept into the ground and pushed the yellow dandelions up, Cathy’s mother finished
hanging the washed clothes on the line. The Ameses lived on the edge of town, and behind their
house were barn and carriage house, vege-table garden and fenced paddock for two horses.

Mrs. Ames remembered having seen Cathy stroll away toward the barn. She called for her, and
when there was no answer she thought she might have been mistaken. She was about to go into
the house when she heard a giggle from the carriage house. “Cathy!” she called. There was no
answer. An uneasiness came over her. She reached back in her mind for the sound of the giggle.
It had not been Cathy’s voice. Cathy was not a giggler.
There is no knowing how or why dread comes on a parent. Of course many times apprehension
arises when there is no reason for it at all. And it comes most often to the parents of only
children, parents who have in-dulged in black dreams of loss.
Mrs. Ames stood still, listening. She heard soft secret voices and moved quietly toward the
carriage house. The double doors were closed. The murmur of voices came from inside, but she
could not make out Cathy’s voice. She made a quick stride and pulled the doors open and the
bright sun crashed inside. She froze, mouth open, at what she saw. Cathy lay on the floor, her
skirts pulled up. She was naked to the waist, and beside her two boys about fourteen were
kneeling. The shock of the sudden light froze them too. Cathy’s eyes were blank with terror. Mrs.
Ames knew the boys, knew their parents.
Suddenly one of the boys leaped up, darted past Mrs. Ames, and ran around the corner of the
house. The other boy helplessly edged away from the woman and with a cry rushed through the
doorway. Mrs. Ames clutched at him, but her fingers slipped from his jacket and he was gone.
She could hear his running-footsteps outside.
Mrs. Ames tried to speak and her voice was a croak-ing whisper. “Get up!”
Cathy stared blankly up at her and made no move. Mrs. Ames saw that Cathy’s wrists were tied
with a heavy rope. She screamed and flung herself down and fumbled at the knots. She carried
Cathy into the house and put her to bed.
The family doctor, after he had examined Cathy, could find no evidence that she had been
mistreated. “You can just thank God you got there in time,” he said over and over to Mrs. Ames.
Cathy did not speak for a long time. Shock, the doctor called it. And when she did come out of
the shock Cathy refused to talk. When she was questioned her eyes widened until the whites
showed all around the pupils and her breathing stopped and her body grew rigid and her cheeks
reddened from holding her breath.
The conference with the parents of the boys was attended by Dr. Williams. Mr. Ames was silent
most of the time. He carried the rope which had been around Cathy’s wrists. His eyes were
puzzled. There were things he did not understand, but he did not bring them up.
Mrs. Ames settled down to a steady hysteria. She had been there. She had seen. She was the final
authori-ty. And out of her hysteria a sadistic devil peered. She wanted blood. There was a kind of
pleasure in her demands for punishment. The town, the country, must be protected. She put it on
that basis. She had arrived in time, thank God. But maybe the next time she would not; and how
would other mothers feel? And Cathy was only ten years old.
Punishments were more savage then than they are now. A man truly believed that the whip was
an instru-ment of virtue. First singly and then together the boys were whipped, whipped-to raw
cuts.

Their crime was bad enough, but the lies proved an evil that not even the whip could remove.
And their defense was from the beginning ridiculous. Cathy, they said, had started the whole
thing, and they had each given her five cents. They had not tied her hands. They said they
remembered that she was playing with a rope.
Mrs. Ames said it first and the whole town echoed it. “Do they mean to say she tied her own
hands? A ten-year-old child?”
If the boys had owned up to the crime they might have escaped some of the punishment. Their
refusal brought a torturing rage not only to their fathers, who did the whipping, but to the whole
community. Both boys were sent to a house of correction with the appro-val of their parents.
“She’s haunted by it,” Mrs. Ames told the neighbors. “If she could only talk about it, maybe she
would get better. But when I ask her about it—it’s like it came right back to her and she goes into
shock again.”
The Ameses never spoke of it to her again. The subject was closed. Mr. Ames very soon forgot
his haunting reservations. He would have felt bad if two boys were in the house of correction for
something they did not do.
After Cathy had fully recovered from her shock, boys and girls watched her from a distance and
then moved closer, fascinated by her. She had no girl crushes, as is usual at twelve and thirteen.
Boys did not want to take the chance of being ragged by their friends for walking home from
school with her. But she exer-cised a powerful effect on both boys and girls. And if any boy
could come on her alone, he found himself drawn to her by a force he could neither understand
nor overcome.
She was dainty and very sweet and her voice was low. She went for long walks by herself, and it
was a rare walk when some boy did not blunder out of a woodlot and come on her by accident.
And while whis-pers went scurrying about, there is no knowing what Cathy did. If anything
happened, only vague whispers followed, and this in itself was unusual at an age when there are
many secrets and none of them kept long enough to raise a cream.
Cathy developed a little smile, just a hint of a smile. She had a way of looking sideways and
down that hinted to a lone boy of secrets he could share.
In her father’s mind another question stirred, and he shoved it down deep and felt dishonest for
thinking about it at all. Cathy had remarkable luck in finding things—a gold charm, money, a
little silken purse, a silver cross with red stones said to be rubies. She found many things, and
when her father advertised in the weekly Courier about the cross no one ever claimed it.
Mr. William Ames, Cathy’s father, was a covered man. He rarely told the thoughts in his mind.
He wouldn’t have dared so far to expose himself to the gaze of his neighbors. He kept the little
flame of suspicion to himself. It was better if he didn’t know anything, safer, wiser, and much
more comfortable. As for Cathy’s mother, she was so bound and twisted in a cocoon of gauzy
half-lies, warped truth, suggestions, all planted by Cathy, that she would not have known a true
thing if it had come to her.

3

Cathy grew more lovely all the time. The delicate blooming skin, the golden hair, the wide-set,
modest, and yet promising eyes, the little mouth full of sweet-ness, caught attention and held it.
She finished the eight grades of grammar school with such a good record that her parents entered
her in the small high school, al-though in that time it was not usual for a girl to go on with her
studies. But Cathy said she wanted to be a teacher, which delighted her mother and father, for this
was the one profession of dignity open to a girl of a good but not well-to-do family. Parents took
honor from a daughter who was a teacher.
Cathy was fourteen when she entered high school. She had always been precious to her parents,
but with her entrance into the rarities of algebra and Latin she climbed into clouds where her
parents could not follow. They had lost her. They felt that she was translated to a higher order.
The teacher of Latin was a pale intense young man who had failed in divinity school and yet had
enough education to teach the inevitable grammar, Caesar, Cicero. He was a quiet young man
who warmed his sense of failure to his bosom. Deep in himself he felt that he had been rejected
by God, and for cause.
For a time it was noticed that a flame leaped in James Grew and some force glowed in his eyes.
He was never seen with Cathy and no relationship was even suspected.
James Grew became a man. He walked on his toes and sang to himself. He wrote letters so
persuasive that the directors of his divinity school looked favorably on readmitting him.
And then the flame went out. His shoulders, held so high and square, folded dejectedly. His eyes
grew fever-ish and his hands twitched. He was seen in church at night, on his knees, moving his
lips over prayers. He missed school and sent word that he was ill when it was known that he was
walking all alone in the hills beyond the town.
One night, late, he tapped on the door of the Ames house. Mr. Ames complained his way out of
bed, light-ed a candle, flung an overcoat over his nightgown, and went to the door. It was a wild
and crazy-looking James Grew who stood before him, his eyes shining and his body one big
shudder.
“I’ve got to see you,” he said hoarsely to Mr. Ames.
“It’s after midnight,” Mr. Ames said sternly.
“I’ve got to see you alone. Put on some clothes and come outside. I’ve got to talk to you.”
‘‘Young man, I think you’re drunk or sick. Go home and get some sleep. It’s after midnight.”
“I can’t wait. I’ve got to talk to you.”
“Come down to the tannery in the morning,” said Mr. Ames, and he closed the door firmly on the
reeling caller and stood inside, listening. He heard the wailing voice, “I can’t wait. I can’t wait,”
and then the feet dragged slowly down the steps.
Mr. Ames shielded the candlelight away from his eyes with his cupped hand and went back to
bed. He thought he saw Cathy’s door close very silently, but perhaps the leaping candlelight had
fooled his eyes, for a portiere seemed to move too.
“What in the world?” his wife demanded when he came back to the bedside.
Mr. Ames didn’t know why he answered as he did—perhaps to save discussion. “A drunken
man,” he said. “Got the wrong house.”

“I don’t know what the world is coming to,” said Mrs. Ames.
As he lay in the darkness after the light was out he saw the green circle left in his eyes by the
candle flame, and in its whirling, pulsing frame he saw the frantic, beseeching eyes of James
Grew. He didn’t go back to sleep for a long time.
In the morning a rumor ran through the town, dis-torted here and there, added to, but by afternoon
the story clarified. The sexton had found James Grew stretched on the floor in front of the altar.
The whole top of his head was blown off. Beside him lay a shot-gun, and beside it the piece of
stick with which he had pushed the trigger. Near him on the floor was a can-dlestick from the
altar. One of the three candles was still burning. The other two had not been lighted. And on the
floor were two books, the hymnal and the Book of Common Prayer, one on top of the other. The
way the sexton figured it, James Grew had propped the gun barrel on the books to bring it in line
with his temple. The recoil of the discharge had thrown the shotgun off the books.
A number of people remembered having heard an explosion early in the morning, before
daylight. James Grew left no letter. No one could figure why he had done it.
Mr. Ames’ first impulse was to go to the coroner with his story of the midnight call. Then he
thought, What good would it do? If I knew anything it would be different. But I don’t know a
single thing. He had a sick feeling in his stomach. He told himself over and over that it was not
his fault. How could I have helped it? I don’t even know what he wanted. He felt guilty and
miserable.
At dinner his wife talked about the suicide and he couldn’t eat. Cathy sat silent, but no more
silent than usual. She ate with little dainty nips and wiped her mouth often on her napkin.
Mrs. Ames went over the matter of the body and the gun in detail. “There’s one thing I meant to
speak of,” she said. “That drunken man who came to the door last night—could that have been
young Grew?”
“No,” he said quickly.
“Are you sure? Could you see him in the dark?”
“I had a candle,” he said sharply. “Didn’t look any-thing like, had a big beard.”
“No need to snap at me,” she said. “I just won-dered.”
Cathy wiped her mouth, and when she laid the nap-kin on her lap she was smiling.
Mrs. Ames turned to her daughter. “You saw him every day in school, Cathy. Has he seemed sad
lately? Did you notice anything that might mean—”
Cathy looked down at her plate and then up. “I thought he was sick,” she said. “Yes, he has
looked bad. Everybody was talking in school today. And somebody—I don’t remember who—
said that Mr. Grew was in some kind of trouble in Boston. I didn’t hear what kind of trouble. We
all liked Mr. Grew.” She wiped her lips delicately.
That was Cathy’s method. Before the next day was out everybody in town knew that James Grew
had been in trouble in Boston, and no one could possibly imagine that Cathy had planted the
story. Even Mrs. Ames had forgotten where she heard it.

Soon after her sixteenth birthday a change came over Cathy. One morning she did not get up for
school. Her mother went into her room and found her in bed, staring at the ceiling. “Hurry, you’ll
be late. It’s nearly nine.”
“I’m not going.” There was no emphasis in her voice.
“Are you sick?”
“No.”
“Then hurry, get up.”
“I’m not going.”
“You must be sick. You’ve never missed a day.”
“I’m not going to school,” Cathy said calmly. “I’m never going to school again.”
Her mother’s mouth fell open. “What do you mean?”
“Not ever,” said Cathy and continued to stare at the ceiling.
“Well, we’ll just see what your father has to say about that! With all our work and expense, and
two years before you get your certificate!” Then she came close and said softly, “You aren’t
thinking of getting married?”
“No.”
“What’s that book you’re hiding?”
“Here, I’m not hiding it.”
“Oh! Alice in Wonderland. You’re too big for that.”
Cathy said, “I can get to be so little you can’t even see me.”
“What in the world are you talking about?”
“Nobody can find me.”
Her mother said angrily, “Stop making jokes. I don’t know what you’re thinking of. What does
Miss Fancy think she is going to do?”
“I don’t know yet,” said Cathy. “I think I’ll go away.”
“Well, you just lie there, Miss Fancy, and when your father comes home he’ll have a thing or two
to say to you.”
Cathy turned her head very slowly and looked at her mother. Her eyes were expressionless and
cold. And suddenly Mrs. Ames was afraid of her daughter. She went out quietly and closed the
door. In her kitchen she sat down and cupped her hands in her lap and stared out the window at
the weathering carriage house.
Her daughter had become a stranger to her. She felt, as most parents do at one time or another,
that she was losing control, that the bridle put in her hands for the governing of Cathy was
slipping through her fingers. She did not know that she had never had any power over Cathy. She
had been used for Cathy’s purposes always. After a while Mrs. Ames put on a bonnet and went to
the tannery. She wanted to talk to her husband away from the house.
In the afternoon Cathy rose listlessly from her bed and spent a long time in front of the mirror.
That evening Mr. Ames, hating what he had to do, delivered a lecture to his daughter. He spoke
of her duty, her obligation, her natural love for her parents. Toward the end of his speech he was
aware that she was not listening to him. This made him angry and he fell into threats. He spoke of

the authority God had given him over his child and of how this natural au-thority had been armed
by the state. He had her atten-tion now. She looked him right in the eyes. Her mouth smiled a
little, and her eyes did not seem to blink. Finally he had to look away, and this enraged him
further. He ordered her to stop her nonsense. Vaguely he threatened her with whipping if she did
not obey him.
He ended on a note of weakness. “I want you to promise me that you will go to school in the
morning and stop your foolishness.”
Her face was expressionless. The little mouth was straight. “All right,” she said.
Later that night Mr. Ames said to his wife with an assurance he did not feel, “You see, it just
needs a little authority. Maybe we’ve been too lax. But she has been a good child. I guess she just
forgot who’s boss. A little sternness never hurt anybody.” He wished he were as confident as his
words.
In the morning she was gone. Her straw traveling basket was gone and the best of her clothing.
Her bed was neatly made. The room was impersonal—nothing to indicate that a girl had grown
up in it. There were no pictures, no mementos, none of the normal clutter of growing. Cathy had
never played with dolls. The room had no Cathy imprint.
In his way Mr. Ames was an intelligent man. He clapped on his derby hat and walked quickly to
the railroad station. The station agent was certain. Cathy had taken the early morning train. She
had bought a ticket for Boston. He helped Mr. Ames write a tele-gram to the Boston police. Mr.
Ames bought a round-trip ticket and caught the nine-fifty train to Boston. He was a very good
man in a crisis.
That night Mrs. Ames sat in the kitchen with the door closed. She was white and she gripped the
table with her hands to control her shaking. The sound, first of the blows and then of the
screaming, came clearly to her through the closed doors.
Mr. Ames was not good at whipping because he had never done it. He lashed at Cathy’s legs with
the buggy whip, and when she stood quietly staring at him with calm cold eyes he lost his temper.
The first blows were tentative and timid, but when she did not cry he slashed at her sides and
shoulders. The whip licked and cut. In his rage he missed her several times or got too close so
that the whip wrapped around her body.
Cathy learned quickly. She found him out and knew him, and once she had learned she screamed,
she writhed, she cried, she begged, and she had the satisfac-tion of feeling the blows instantly
become lighter.
Mr. Ames was frightened at the noise and hurt he was creating. He stopped. Cathy dropped back
on the bed, sobbing. And if he had looked, her father would have seen that there were no tears in
her eyes, but rather the muscles of her neck were tight and there were lumps just under her
temples where the jaw mus-cles knotted.
He said, “Now, will you ever do that again?”
“No, oh, no! Forgive me,” Cathy said. She turned over on the bed so that her father could not see
the coldness in her face.
“See you remember who you are. And don’t forget what I am.”

Cathy’s voice caught. She produced a dry sob. “I won’t forget,” she said.
In the kitchen Mrs. Ames wrestled her hands. Her husband put his fingers on her shoulder.
“I hated to do it,” he said. “I had to. And I think it did her good. She seems like a changed girl to
me. Maybe we haven’t bent the twig enough. We’ve spared the rod. Maybe we were wrong.”
And he knew that although his wife had insisted on the whipping, al-though she had forced him
to whip Cathy, she hated him for doing it. Despair settled over him.

5
There seemed no doubt that it was what Cathy needed. As Mr. Ames said, “It kind of opened her
up.” She had always been tractable but now she became thoughtful too. In the weeks that
followed she helped her mother in the kitchen and offered to help more than was need-ed. She
started to knit an afghan for her mother, a large project that would take months. Mrs. Ames told
the neighbors about it. “She has such a fine color sense—rust and yellow. She’s finished three
squares already.”
For her father Cathy kept a ready smile. She hung up his hat when he came in and turned his
chair properly under the light to make it easy for him to read.
Even in school she was changed. Always she had been a good student, but now she began to
make plans for the future. She talked to the principal about exami-nations for her teaching
certificate, perhaps a year ear-ly. And the principal looked over her record and thought she might
well try it with hope of success. He called on Mr. Ames at the tannery to discuss it.
“She didn’t tell us any of this,” Mr. Ames said proudly.
“Well, maybe I shouldn’t have told you. I hope I haven’t ruined a surprise.”
Mr. and Mrs. Ames felt that they had blundered on some magic which solved all of their
problems. They put it down to an unconscious wisdom which comes only to parents. “I never saw
such a change in a person in my life,” Mr. Ames said.
“But she was always a good child,” said his wife. “And have you noticed how pretty she’s
getting? Why, she’s almost beautiful. Her cheeks have so much color.”
“I don’t think she’ll be teaching school long with her looks,” said Mr. Ames.
It was true that Cathy glowed. The childlike smile was constantly on her lips while she went
about her preparations. She had all the time in the world. She cleaned the cellar and stuffed
papers all around the edges of the foundation to block the draft. When the kitchen door squeaked
she oiled the hinges and then the lock that turned too hard, and while she had the oil can out she
oiled the front-door hinges too. She made it her duty to keep the lamps filled and their chimneys
clean. She invented a way of dipping the chimneys in a big can of kerosene she had in the
basement.
“You’d have to see it to believe it,” her father said. And it wasn’t only at home either. She braved
the smell of the tannery to visit her father. She was just past sixteen and of course he thought of
her as a baby. He was amazed at her questions about business.
“She’s smarter than some men I could name,” he told his foreman. “She might be running the
business someday.”

She was interested not only in the tanning processes but in the business end too. Her father
explained the loans, the payments, the billing, and the payroll. He showed her how to open the
safe and was pleased that after the first try she remembered the combination.
“The way I look at it is this,” he told his wife. “We’ve all of us got a little of the Old Nick in us. I
wouldn’t want a child that didn’t have some gumption. The way I see it, that’s just a kind of
energy. If you just check it and keep it in control, why, it will go in the right direction.”
Cathy mended all of her clothes and put her things in order.
One day in May she came home from school and went directly to her knitting needles. Her
mother was dressed to go out. “I have to go to the Altar Guild,” she said. “It’s about the cake sale
next week. I’m chairman. Your father wondered if you would go by the bank and pick up the
money for the payroll and take it to the tannery. I told him about the cake sale so I can’t do it.”
“I’d like to,” said Cathy.
“They’ll have the money ready for you in a bag,” said Mrs. Ames, and she hurried out.
Cathy worked quickly but without hurry. She put on an old apron to cover her clothes. In the
basement she found a jelly jar with a top and carried it out to the carriage house where the tools
were kept. In the chickenyard she caught a little pullet, took it to the block and chopped its head
off, and held the writhing neck over the jelly jar until it was full of blood. Then she carried the
quivering pullet to the manure pile and buried it deep. Back in the kitchen she took off the apron
and put it in the stove and poked the coals until a flame sprang up on the cloth. She washed her
hands and inspected her shoes and stockings and wiped a dark spot from the toe of her right shoe.
She looked at her face in the mirror. Her cheeks were bright with color and her eyes shone and
her mouth turned up in its small childlike smile. On her way out she hid the jelly jar under the
lowest part of the kitchen steps. Her mother had not been gone even ten minutes.
Cathy walked lightly, almost dancingly around the house and into the street. The trees were
breaking into leaf and a few early dandelions were in yellow flower on the lawns. Cathy walked
gaily toward the center of the town where the bank was. And she was so fresh and pretty that
people walking turned and looked after her when she had passed.

The fire broke out at about three o’clock in the morn-ing. It rose, flared, roared, crashed, and
crumbled in on itself almost before anyone noticed it. When the volun-teers ran up, pulling their
hose cart, there was nothing for them to do but wet down the roofs of the neighbor-ing houses to
keep them from catching fire.
The Ames house had gone up like a rocket. The volunteers and the ordinary audience fires attract
looked around at the lighted faces, trying to see Mr. and Mrs. Ames and their daughter. It came to
everyone at once that they were not there. People gazed at the broad ember-bed and saw
themselves and their children in there, and hearts rose up and pumped against throats. The
volunteers began to dump water on the fire almost as though they might even so late save some
corporeal part of the family. The frightened talk ran through the town that the whole Ames family
had burned.

By sunrise everyone in town was tight-packed about the smoking black pile. Those in front had to
shield their faces against the heat. The volunteers continued to pump water to cool off the charred
mess. By noon the coroner was able to throw wet planks down and probe with a crowbar among
the sodden heaps of charcoal. Enough remained of Mr. and Mrs. Ames to make sure there were
two bodies. Near neighbors pointed out the approximate place where Cathy’s room had been, but
although the coroner and any number of helpers worked over the debris with a garden rake they
could find no tooth or bone.
The chief of the volunteers meanwhile had found the doorknobs and lock of the kitchen door. He
looked at the blackened metal, puzzled, but not quite knowing what puzzled him. He borrowed
the coroner’s rake and worked furiously. He went to the place where the front door had been and
raked until he found that lock, crooked and half melted. By now he had his own small crowd,
who demanded, “What are you looking for, George?” And “What did you find, George?”
Finally the coroner came over to him. “What’s on your mind, George?”
“No keys in the locks,” the chief said uneasily.
“Maybe they fell out.”
“How?”
“Maybe they melted.”
“The locks didn’t melt.”
“Maybe Bill Ames took them out.”
“On the inside?” He held up his trophies. Both bolts stuck out.
Since the owner’s house was burned and the owner ostensibly burned with it, the employees of
the tannery, out of respect, did not go to work. They hung around the burned house, offering to
help in any way they could, feeling official and generally getting in the way.
It wasn’t until afternoon that Joel Robinson, the foreman, went down to the tannery. He found the
safe open and papers scattered all over the floor. A broken window showed how the thief had
entered.
Now the whole complexion changed. So, it was not an accident. Fear took the place of
excitement and sorrow, and anger, brother of fear, crept in. The crowd began to spread.
They had not far to go. In the carriage house there was what is called “signs of a struggle”—in
this case a broken box, a shattered carriage lamp, scraped marks in the dust, and straw on the
floor. The onlookers might not have known these as signs of a struggle had there not been a
quantity of blood on the floor.
The constable took control. This was his province. He pushed and herded everyone out of the
carriage house. “Want to gum up all the clues?” he shouted at them. “Now you all stay clear
outside the door.”
He searched the room, picked up something, and in a corner found something else. He came to
the door, holding his discoveries in his hands—a blood-splattered blue hair ribbon and a cross
with red stones. “Anybody recognize these here?” he demanded.
In a small town where everyone knows everyone it is almost impossible to believe that one of
your acquaint-ance could murder anyone. For that reason, if the signs are not pretty strong in a

particular direction, it must be some dark stranger, some wanderer from the outside world where
such things happen. Then the hobo camps are raided and vagrants brought in and hotel registers
scrutinized. Every man who is not known is automati-cally suspected. It was May, remember, and
the wan-dering men had only recently taken to the roads, now that the warming months let them
spread their blankets by any water course. And the gypsies were out too—a whole caravan less
than five miles away. And what a turning out those poor gypsies got!
The ground for miles around was searched for new-turned earth, and likely pools were dragged
for Cathy’s body. “She was so pretty,” everyone said, and they meant that in themselves they
could see a reason for carrying Cathy off. At length a bumbling hairy half-wit was brought in for
questioning. He was a fine candidate for hanging because not only did he have no alibis, he could
not remember what he had done at anytime in his life. His feeble mind sensed that these
questioners wanted something of him and, being a friendly crea-ture, he tried to give it to them.
When a baited and set question was offered to him, he walked happily into the trap and was glad
when the constable looked happy. He tried manfully to please these superior beings. There was
something very nice about him. The only trouble with his confession was that he confessed too
much in too many directions. Also, he had constantly to be reminded of what he was supposed to
have done. He was really pleased when he was indicted by a stern and frightened jury. He felt
that at last he amounted to something.
There were, and are, some men who become judges whose love for the law and for its intention
of promoting justice has the quality of love for a woman. Such a man presided at the examination
before plea—a man so pure and good that he canceled out a lot of wickedness with his life.
Without the prompting the culprit was used to, his confession was nonsense. The judge questioned him and found out that although the suspect was trying to follow instructions he simply
could not remember what he had done, whom he had killed, how or why. The judge sighed
wearily and motioned him out of the courtroom and crooked his fingers at the constable.
“Now look here, Mike,” he said, “you shouldn’t do a thing like that. If that poor fellow had been
just a little smarter you might have got him hanged.”
“He said he did it.” The constable’s feelings were hurt because he was a conscientious man.
“He would have admitted climbing the golden stairs and cutting St. Peter’s throat with a bowling
ball,” the judge said. “Be more careful, Mike. The law was de-signed to save, not to destroy.”
In all such local tragedies time works like a damp brush on water color. The sharp edges blur, the
ache goes out of it, the colors melt together, and from the many separated lines a solid gray
emerges. Within a month it was not so necessary to hang someone, and within two months nearly
everybody discovered that there wasn’t any real evidence against anyone. If it had not been for
Cathy’s murder, fire and robbery might have been a coincidence. Then it occurred to people that
without Cathy’s body you couldn’t prove anything even though you thought she was dead.
Cathy left a scent of sweetness behind her.

Chapter 9
1
Mr. Edwards carried on his business of whoremaster in an orderly and unemotional way. He
maintained his wife and his two well-mannered children in a good house in a good neighborhood
in Boston. The children, two boys, were entered on the books at Groton when they were infants.
Mrs. Edwards kept a dustless house and controlled her servants. There were of course many times
when Mr. Edwards had to be away from home on business, but he managed to live an amazingly
domestic life and to spend more evenings at home than you could imag-ine. He ran his business
with a public accountant’s neatness and accuracy. He was a large and powerful man, running a
little to fat in his late forties, and yet in surprisingly good condition for a time when a man
wanted to be fat if only to prove he was a success.
He had invented his business—the circuit route through the small towns, the short stay of each
girl, the discipline, the percentages. He felt his way along and made few mistakes. He never sent
his girls into the cities. He could handle the hungry constables of the villages, but he had respect
for the experienced and voracious big city police. His ideal stand was a small town with a
mortgaged hotel and no amusements, one where his only competition came from wives and an
occasional wayward girl. At this time he had ten units. Before he died at sixty-seven of
strangulation on a chicken bone, he had groups of four girls in each of thirty-three small towns in
New England. He was better than well fixed—he was rich; and the manner of his death was in
itself symbolic of success and well-being.
At the present time the institution of the whorehouse seems to a certain extent to be dying out.
Scholars have various reasons to give. Some say that the decay of morality among girls has dealt
the whorehouse its deathblow. Others, perhaps more idealistic, maintain that police supervision
on an increased scale is driving the houses out of existence. In the late days of the last century
and the early part of this one, the whorehouse was an accepted if not openly discussed institution.
It was said that its existence protected decent women. An unmarried man could go to one of these
houses and evacuate the sexual energy which was making him uneasy and at the same time
maintain the popular attitudes about the purity and loveliness of women. It was a mystery, but
then there are many mysterious things in our social thinking.
These houses ranged from palaces filled with gold and velvet to the crummiest cribs where the
stench would drive a pig away. Every once in a while a story would start about how young girls
were stolen and enslaved by the controllers of the industry, and perhaps many of the stories were
true. But the great majority of whores drifted into their profession through laziness and stupidity.
In the houses they had no responsibility. They were fed and clothed and taken care of until they
were too old, and then they were kicked out. This ending was no deterrent. No one who is young

is ever going to be old.
Now and then a smart girl came into the profession, but she usually moved up to better things.
She got a house of her own or worked successfully at blackmail or married a rich man. There was
even a special name for the smart ones. They were grandly called cour-tesans.
Mr. Edwards had no trouble either in recruiting or in controlling his girls. If a girl was not
properly stupid, he threw her out. He did not want very pretty girls either. Some local young man
might fall in love with a pretty whore and there would be hell to pay. When any of his girls
became pregnant they had the choice of leaving or of being aborted so brutally that a fair
proportion died. In spite of this the girls usually chose abortion.
It was not always smooth sailing for Mr. Edwards. He did have his problems. At the time of
which I am telling you he had been subjected to a series of misfortunes. A train wreck had killed
off two units of four girls each. Another of his units he lost to conversion when a small-town
preacher suddenly caught fire and began igniting the townsfolk with his sermons. The swelling
congregation had to move out of the church and into the fields. Then, as happens so often, the
preacher turned over his hole-card, the sure-fire card. He predicted the date of the end of the
world, and the whole county moved bleating in on him. Mr. Edwards went to the town, took the
heavy quirt from his suitcase, and whipped the girls unmercifully; instead of seeing the thing his
way, the girls begged for more whipping to wipe out their fancied sins. He gave up in disgust,
took their clothes, and went back to Boston. The girls achieved a certain prominence when they
went naked to the camp meeting to confess and testify. That is how Mr. Edwards happened to be
interviewing and recruiting numbers of girls instead of picking one up here and there. He had
three units to rebuild from the ground.
I don’t know how Cathy Ames heard about Mr. Edwards. Perhaps a hack driver told her. The
word got around when a girl really wanted to know. Mr. Ed-wards had not had a good morning
when she came into his office. The pain in his stomach he ascribed to a halibut chowder his wife
had given him for supper the night before. He had been up all night. The chowder had blown both
ways and he still felt weak and crampy.
For this reason he did not take in all at once the girl who called herself Catherine Amesbury. She
was far too pretty for his business. Her voice was low and throaty, she was slight, almost delicate,
and her skin was lovely. In a word she was not Mr. Edwards’ kind of girl at all. If he had not been
weak he would have rejected her instantly. But while he did not look at her very closely during
the routine questioning, mostly about relatives who might cause trouble, something in Mr.
Edwards’ body began to feel her. Mr. Edwards was not a concupiscent man, and besides he never
mixed his professional life with his private pleasures. His reaction startled him. He looked up,
puzzled, at the girl, and her eyelids dipped sweetly and mysteriously, and there was just a
suggestion of a sway on her lightly padded hips. Her little mouth wore a cat smile. Mr. Edwards
leaned forward at his desk, breathing heavily. He realized that he wanted this one for his own.
“I can’t understand why a girl like you—” he began, and fell right into the oldest conviction in
the world—that the girl you are in love with can’t possibly be any-thing but true and honest.
“My father is dead,” Catherine said modestly. “Be-fore he died he had let things go to pieces. We

didn’t know he had borrowed money on the farm. And I can’t let the bank take it away from my
mother. The shock would kill her.” Catherine’s eyes dimmed with tears. “I thought maybe I could
make enough to keep up the interest.”
If ever Mr. Edwards had a chance it was now. And indeed a little warning buzz did sound in his
brain, but it was not loud enough. About eighty per cent of the girls who came to him needed
money to pay off a mortgage. And Mr. Edwards made it an unvarying rule not to believe
anything his girls said at any time, be-yond what they had for breakfast, and they sometimes lied
about that. And here he was, a big, fat, grown-up whoremaster, leaning his stomach against his
desk while his cheeks darkened with blood and excited chills ran up his legs and thighs.
Mr. Edwards heard himself saying, “Well now, my dear, let’s talk this over. Maybe we can figure
some way for you to get the interest money.” And this to a girl who had simply asked for a job as
a whore—or had she?

2
Mrs. Edwards was persistently if not profoundly reli-gious. She spent a great part of her time
with the mechanics of her church, which did not leave her time for either its background or its
effects. To her, Mr. Edwards was in the importing business, and even if she had known—which
she probably did—what business he was really in, she would not have believed it. And this is
another mystery. Her husband had always been to her a coldly thoughtful man who made few and
dutiful physical demands on her. If he had never been warm, he had never been cruel either. Her
dramas and her emotions had to do with the boys, with the vestry, and with food. She was content
with her life and thank-ful. When her husband’s disposition began to disinte-grate, causing him to
be restless and snappish, to sit staring and then to rush out of the house in a nervous rage, she
ascribed it first to his stomach and then to business reverses. When by accident she came upon
him in the bathroom, sitting on the toilet and crying softly to himself, she knew he was a sick
man. He tried quickly to cover his red, brimming eyes from her scru-tiny. When neither herb teas
nor physics cured him she was helpless.
If in all the years Mr. Edwards had heard about anyone like himself he would have laughed. For
Mr. Edwards, as cold-blooded a whoremaster as ever lived, had fallen hopelessly, miserably in
love with Catherine Amesbury. He rented a sweet little brick house for her and then gave it to
her. He bought her every imaginable luxury, overdecorated the house, kept it overwarm. The
carpeting was too deep and the walls were crowded with heavy framed pictures.
Mr. Edwards had never experienced such misery. As a matter of business he had learned so much
about women that he did not trust one for a second. And since he deeply loved Catherine and love
requires trust, he was torn to quivering fragments by his emotion. He had to trust her and at the
same time he did not trust her. He tried to buy her loyalty with presents and with money. When
he was away from her, he tortured him-self with the thought of other men slipping into her house.
He hated to leave Boston to check up on his units because this would leave Catherine alone. To a
certain extent he began to neglect his business. It was his first experience with this kind of love
and it nearly killed him.

One thing Mr. Edwards did not know, and could not know because Catherine would not permit it,
was that she was faithful to him in the sense that she did not receive or visit other men. To
Catherine, Mr. Edwards was as cold a business proposition as his units were to him. And as he
had his techniques, so had she hers. Once she had him, which was very soon, she managed
always to seem slightly dissatisfied. She gave him an impression of restlessness, as though she
might take flight at any moment. When she knew he was going to visit her, she made it a point to
be out and to come in glowing as from some incredible experience. She com-plained a good deal
about the difficulties of avoiding the lecherous looks and touches of men in the street who could
not keep away from her. Several times she ran frightened into the house, having barely escaped a
man who had followed her. When she would return in the late afternoon and find him waiting for
her she would explain, “Why, I was shopping. I have to go shopping, you know.” And she made
it sound like a lie.
In their sexual relations she convinced him that the result was not quite satisfactory to her, that if
he were a better man he could release a flood of unbelievable reaction in her. Her method was to
keep him continual-ly off balance. She saw with satisfaction his nerves begin to go, his hands
take to quivering, his loss of weight, and the wild glazed look in his eyes. And when she
delicately sensed the near approach of insane, pun-ishing rage, she sat in his lap and soothed him
and made him believe for a moment in her innocence. She could convince him.
Catherine wanted money, and she set about getting it as quickly and as easily as she could. When
she had successfully reduced him to a pulp, and Catherine knew exactly when the time had come,
she began to steal from him. She went through his pockets and took any large bills she found. He
didn’t dare accuse her for fear she would go away. The presents of jewelry he gave her
disappeared, and although she said she had lost them he knew they had been sold. She padded the
grocery bills, added to the prices of clothes. He could not bring himself to stop it. She did not sell
the house but she mortgaged it for every penny she could get.
One evening his key did not fit the lock of the front door. She answered his pounding after a long
time. Yes, she had changed the locks because she had lost her key. She was afraid, living alone.
Anyone could get in. She would get him another key—but she never did. He always had to ring
the bell after that, and some-times it took a long time for her to answer, and at other times his ring
was not answered at all. There was no way for him to know whether she was at home or not. Mr.
Edwards had her followed—and she did not know how often.
Mr. Edwards was essentially a simple man, but even a simple man has complexities which are
dark and twisted. Catherine was clever, but even a clever woman misses some of the strange
corridors in a man.
She made only one bad slip, and she had tried to avoid that one. As was proper, Mr. Edwards had
stocked the pretty little nest with champagne. Catherine had from the first refused to touch it.
“It makes me sick,” she explained. “I’ve tried it and I can’t drink it.”
“Nonsense,” he said. “Just have one glass. It can’t hurt you.”
“No, thank you. No. I can’t drink it.”
Mr. Edwards thought of her reluctance as a delicate, a ladylike quality. He had never insisted

until one evening when it occurred to him that he knew nothing about her. Wine might loosen her
tongue. The more he thought of it, the better the idea seemed to him.
“It’s not friendly of you not to have a glass with me.”
“I tell you, it doesn’t agree with me.”
“Nonsense.”
“I tell you I don’t want it.”
“This is silly,” he said. “Do you want me to be angry with you?”
“No.”
“Then drink a glass.”
“I don’t want it.”
“Drink it.” He held a glass for her, and she retreated from it.
“You don’t know. It’s not good for me.”
“Drink it.”
She took the glass and poured it down and stood still, quivering, seeming to listen. The blood
flowed to her cheeks. She poured another glass for herself and another. Her eyes became set and
cold. Mr. Edwards felt a fear of her. Something was happening to her which neither she nor he
could control.
“I didn’t want to do it. Remember that,” she said calmly.
“Maybe you’d better not have any more.”
She laughed and poured herself another glass. “It doesn’t matter now,” she said. “More won’t
make much difference.”
“It’s nice to have a glass or so,” he said uneasily.
She spoke to him softly. “You fat slug,” she said. “What do you know about me? Do you think I
can’t read every rotten thought you ever had? Want me to tell you? You wonder where a nice girl
like me learned tricks. I’ll tell you. I learned them in cribs—you hear?—cribs. I’ve worked in
places you never even heard of—four years. Sailors brought me little tricks from Port Said. I
know every nerve in your lousy body and I can use them.”
“Catherine,” he protested, “you don’t know what you’re saying.”
“I could see it. You thought I would talk. Well, I’m talking.”
She advanced slowly toward him, and Mr. Edwards overcame his impulse to edge away. He was
afraid of her but he sat still. Directly in front of him she drank the last champagne in her glass,
delicately struck the rim on the table, and jammed the ragged edge against his cheek.
And then he did run from the house and he could hear her laughing as he went.

3
Love to a man like Mr. Edwards is a crippling emo-tion. It ruined his judgment, canceled his
knowledge, weakened him. He told himself that she was hysterical and tried to believe it, and it
was made easier for him by Catherine. Her outbreak had terrified her, and for a time she made
every effort to restore his sweet picture of her.
A man so painfully in love is capable of self-torture beyond belief. Mr. Edwards wanted with all

his heart to believe in her goodness, but he was forced not to, as much by his own particular devil
as by her outbreak. Almost instinctively he went about learning the truth and at the same time
disbelieved it. He knew, for instance, that she would not put her money in a bank. One of his
employees, using a complicated set of mir-rors, found out the place in the cellar of the little brick
house where she did keep it.
One day a clipping came from the agency he em-ployed. It was an old newspaper account of a
fire from a small-town weekly. Mr. Edwards studied it. His chest and stomach turned to molten
metal and a redness glowed in his head behind his eyes. There was real fear mixed up in his love,
and the precipitate from the mixing of these two is cruelty. He staggered dizzily to his office
couch and lay face down, his forehead against the cool black leather. For a time he hung
suspended, hardly breathing. Gradually his brain cleared. His mouth tasted salty, and there was a
great ache of anger in his shoulders. But he was calm and his mind cut its intention through time
like the sharp beam of a search-light through a dark room. He moved slowly, checking his
suitcase just as he always did when he started out to inspect his units—clean shirts and
underwear, a night-gown and slippers, and the heavy quirt with the lash curving around the end of
the suitcase.
He moved heavily up the little garden in front of the brick house and rang the bell.
Catherine answered it immediately. She had on her coat and hat.
“Oh!” she said. “What a shame! I must go out for a while.”
Mr. Edwards put down his suitcase. “No,” he said.
She studied him. Something was changed. He lum-bered past her and went down into the cellar.
“Where are you going?” Her voice was shrill.
He did not reply. In a moment he came up again, carrying a small oak box. He opened his
suitcase and put the box inside.
“That’s mine,” she said softly.
“I know.”
“What are you up to?”
“I thought we’d go for a little trip.”
“Where? I can’t go.”
“Little town in Connecticut. I have some business there. You told me once you wanted to work.
You’re going to work.”
“I don’t want to now. You can’t make me. Why, I’ll call the police!”
He smiled so horribly that she stepped back from him. His temples were thudding with blood.
“Maybe you’d rather go to your home town,” he said. “They had a big fire there several years
ago. Do you remember that fire?”
Her eyes probed and searched him, seeking a soft place, but his eyes were flat and hard. “What
do you want me to do?” she asked quietly.
“Just come for a little trip with me. You said you wanted to work.”
She could think of only one plan. She must go along with him and wait for a chance. A man
couldn’t always watch. It would be dangerous to thwart him now—best go along with it and wait.

That always worked. It always had. But his words had given Catherine real fear.
In the small town they got off the train at dusk, walked down its one dark street, and on out into
the country. Catherine was wary and watchful. She had no access to his plan. In her purse she had
a thin-bladed knife.
Mr. Edwards thought he knew what he intended to do. He meant to whip her and put her in one of
the rooms at the inn, whip her and move her to another town, and so on until she was of no use
any more. Then he would throw her out. The local constable would see to it that she did not run
away. The knife did not bother him. He knew about that.
The first thing he did when they stopped in a private place between a stone wall and a fringe of
cedars was to jerk the purse from her hand and throw it over the wall. That took care of the knife.
But he didn’t know about himself, because in all his life he had never been in love with a woman.
He thought he only meant to punish her. After two slashes the quirt was not enough. He dropped
it on the ground and used his fists. His breath-ing came out in squealing whines.
Catherine did her best not to fall into panic. She tried to duck his threshing fists or at least to
make them ineffective, but at last fear overcame her and she tried to run. He leaped at her and
brought her down, and by then his fists were not enough. His frantic hand found a stone on the
ground and his cold control was burst through with a red roaring wave.
Later he looked down on her beaten face. He lis-tened for her heartbeat and could hear nothing
over the thumping of his own. Two complete and separate thoughts ran in his mind. One said,
“Have to bury her, have to dig a hole and put her in it.” And the other cried like a child, “I can’t
stand it. I couldn’t bear to touch her.” Then the sickness that follows rage over-whelmed him. He
ran from the place, leaving his suitcase, leaving the quirt, leaving the oak box of mon-ey. He
blundered away in the dusk, wondering only where he could hide his sickness for a while.
No question was ever asked of him. After a time of sickness to which his wife ministered
tenderly, he went back to his business and never again let the insanity of love come near him. A
man who can’t learn from experience is a fool, he said. Always afterward he had a kind of fearful
respect for himself. He had never known that the impulse to kill was in him.
That he had not killed Catherine was an accident. Every blow had been intended to crush her. She
was a long time unconscious and a long time half-conscious. She realized her arm was broken
and that she must find help if she wanted to live. Wanting to live forced her to drag herself along
the dark road, looking for help. She turned in at a gate and almost made the steps of the house
before she fainted. The roosters were crowing in the chickenhouse and a gray rim of dawn lay on
the east.

Chapter 10
1
When two men live together they usually maintain a kind of shabby neatness out of incipient rage
at each other. Two men alone are constantly on the verge of fighting, and they know it. Adam
Trask had not been home long before the tensions began to build up. The brothers saw too much
of each other and not enough of anyone else.
For a few months they were busy getting Cyrus’s money in order and out at interest. They
traveled to-gether to Washington to look at the grave, good stone and on top an iron star with seal
and a hole on the top in which to insert the stick for a little flag on Decora-tion Day. The brothers
stood by the grave a long time, then they went away and they didn’t mention Cyrus.
If Cyrus had been dishonest he had done it well. No one asked questions about the money. But
the subject was on Charles’ mind.
Back on the farm Adam asked him, “Why don’t you buy some new clothes? You’re a rich man.
You act like you’re afraid to spend a penny.”
“I am,” said Charles.
“Why?”
“I might have to give it back.”
“Still harping on that? If there was anything wrong, don’t you think we’d have heard about it by
now?”
“I don’t know,” said Charles. “I’d rather not talk about it.”
But that night he brought up the subject again. “There’s one thing bothers me,” he began.
“About the money?”
“Yes, about the money. If you make that much money there’s bound to be a mess.”
“How do you mean?”
“Well, papers and account books and bills of sale, notes, figuring—well, we went through
Father’s things and there wasn’t none of that.”
“Maybe he burned it up.”
“Maybe he did,” said Charles.
The brothers lived by a routine established by Charles, and he never varied it. Charles awakened
on the stroke of four-thirty as surely as though the brass pendulum of the clock had nudged him.
He was awake, in fact, a split second before four-thirty. His eyes were open and had blinked once
before the high gong struck. For a moment he lay still, looking up into the darkness and
scratching his stomach. Then he reached to the table beside his bed and his hand fell exactly on
the block of sulphur matches lying there. His fingers pulled a match free and struck it on the side
of the block. The sulphur burned its little blue bead be-fore the wood caught. Charles lighted the

candle beside his bed. He threw back his blanket and got up. He wore long gray underwear that
bagged over his knees and hung loose around his ankles. Yawning, he went to the door, opened
it, and called, “Half-past four, Adam. Time to get up. Wake up.”
Adam’s voice was muffled. “Don’t you ever forget?”
“It’s time to get up.” Charles slipped his legs into his pants and hunched them up over his hips.
“You don’t have to get up,” he said. “You’re a rich man. You can lay in bed all day.”
“So are you. But we still get up before daylight.”
“You don’t have to get up,” Charles repeated. “But if you’re going to farm, you’d better farm.”
Adam said ruefully, “So we’re going to buy more land so we can do more work.”
“Come off it,” said Charles. “Go back to bed if you want to.”
Adam said, “I bet you couldn’t sleep if you stayed in bed. You know what I bet? I bet you get up
because you want to, and then you take credit for it—like taking credit for six fingers.”
Charles went into the kitchen and lighted the lamp. “You can’t lay in bed and run a farm,” he
said, and he knocked the ashes through the grate of the stove and tore some paper over the
exposed coals and blew until the flames started.
Adam was watching him through the door. “You wouldn’t use a match,” he said.
Charles turned angrily. “You mind your own god-dam business. Stop picking at me.”
“All right,” said Adam. “I will. And maybe my business isn’t here.”
“That’s up to you. Any time you want to get out, you go right ahead.”
The quarrel was silly but Adam couldn’t stop it. His voice went on without his willing it, making
angry and irritating words. “You’re damn right I’ll go when I want,” he said. “This is my place as
much as yours.”
“Then why don’t you do some work on it?”
“Oh, Lord!” Adam said. “What are we fussing about? Let’s not fuss.”
“I don’t want trouble,” said Charles. He scooped lukewarm mush into two bowls and spun them
on the table.
The brothers sat down. Charles buttered a slice of bread, gouged out a knifeful of jam, and spread
it over the butter. He dug butter for his second slice and left a slop of jam on the butter roll.
“Goddam it, can’t you wipe your knife? Look at that butter!”
Charles laid his knife and the bread on the table and placed his hands palm down on either side.
“You better get off the place,” he said.
Adam got up. “I’d rather live in a pigsty,” he said, and he walked out of the house.

2
It was eight months before Charles saw him again. Charles came in from work and found Adam
sloshing water on his hair and face from the kitchen bucket.
“Hello,” said Charles. “How are you?”
“Fine,” said Adam.
“Where’d you go?”
“Boston.”

“No place else?”
“No. Just looked at the city.”
The brothers settled back to their old life, but each took precautions against anger. In a way each
protected the other and so saved himself. Charles, always the early riser, got breakfast ready
before he awakened Adam. And Adam kept the house clean and started a set of books on the
farm. In this guarded way they lived for two years before their irritation grew beyond control
again.
On a winter evening Adam looked up from his ac-count book. “It’s nice in California,” he said.
“It’s nice in the winter. And you can raise anything there.”
“Sure you can raise it. But when you got it, what are you going to do with it?”
“How about wheat? They raise a lot of wheat in California.”
“The rust will get to it,” said Charles.
“What makes you so sure? Look, Charles, things grow so fast in California they say you have to
plant and step back quick or you’ll get knocked down.”
Charles said, “Why the hell don’t you go there? I’ll buy you out any time you say.”
Adam was quiet then, but in the morning while he combed his hair and peered in the small mirror
he began it again.
“They don’t have any winter in California,” he said. “It’s just like spring all the time.”
“I like the winter,” said Charles.
Adam came toward the stove. “Don’t be cross,” he said.
“Well, stop picking at me. How many eggs?”
“Four,” said Adam.
Charles placed seven eggs on top of the warming oven and built his fire carefully of small pieces
of kindling until it burned fiercely. He put the skillet down next to the flame. His sullenness left
him as he fried the bacon.
“Adam,” he said, “I don’t know whether you notice it, but it seems like every other word you say
is Califor-nia. Do you really want to go?”
Adam chuckled. “That’s what I’m trying to figure out,” he said. “I don’t know. It’s like getting
up in the morning. I don’t want to get up but I don’t want to stay in bed either.”
“You sure make a fuss about it.” said Charles.
Adam went on, “Every morning in the army that damned bugle would sound. And I swore to God
if I ever got out I would sleep till noon every day. And here I get up a half-hour before reveille.
Will you tell me, Charles, what in hell we’re working for?”
“You can’t lay in bed and run a farm,” said Charles. He stirred the hissing bacon around with a
fork.
“Take a look at it,” Adam said earnestly. “Neither one of us has got a chick or a child, let alone a
wife. And the way we’re going it don’t look like we ever will. We don’t have time to look around
for a wife. And here we’re figuring to add the Clark place to ours if the price is right. What for?”
“It’s a damn fine piece,” said Charles. “The two of them together would make one of the best
farms in this section. Say! You thinking of getting married?”

“No. And that’s what I’m talking about. Come a few years and we’ll have the finest farm in this
section. Two lonely old farts working our tails off. Then one of us will die off and the fine farm
will belong to one lonely old fart, and then he’ll die off—”
“What the hell are you talking about?” Charles de-manded. “Fellow can’t get comfortable. You
make me itch. Get it out—what’s on your mind?”
“I’m not having any fun,” said Adam. “Or anyway I’m not having enough. I’m working too hard
for what I’m getting, and I don’t have to work at all.”
“Well, why don’t you quit?” Charles shouted at him. “Why don’t you get the hell out? I don’t see
any guards holding you. Go down to the South Seas and lay in a hammock if that’s what you
want.”
“Don’t be cross,” said Adam quietly. “It’s like get-ting up. I don’t want to get up and I don’t want
to stay down. I don’t want to stay here and I don’t want to go away.”
“You make me itch,” said Charles.
“Think about it, Charles. You like it here?”
“Yes.”
“And you want to live here all your life?”
“Yes.”
“Jesus, I wish I had it that easy. What do you suppose is the matter with me?”
“I think you’ve got knocker fever. Come in to the inn tonight and get it cured up.”
“Maybe that’s it,” said Adam. “But I never took much satisfaction in a whore.”
“It’s all the same,” Charles said. “You shut your eyes and you can’t tell the difference.”
“Some of the boys in the regiment used to keep a squaw around. I had one for a while.”
Charles turned to him with interest. “Father would turn in his grave if he knew you was squawing
around. How was it?”
“Pretty nice. She’d wash my clothes and mend and do a little cooking.”
“I mean the other—how was that?”
“Good. Yes, good. And kind of sweet—kind of soft and sweet. Kind of gentle and soft.”
“You’re lucky she didn’t put a knife in you while you were asleep.”
“She wouldn’t. She was sweet.”
“You’ve got a funny look in your eye. I guess you were kind of gone on that squaw.”
“I guess I was,” said Adam.
“What happened to her?”
“Smallpox.”
“You didn’t get another one?”
Adam’s eyes were pained. “We piled them up like they were logs, over two hundred, arms and
legs sticking out. And we piled brush on top and poured coal oil on.”
“I’ve heard they can’t stand smallpox.”
“It kills them,” said Adam. “You’re burning that bacon.”
Charles turned quickly back to the stove. “It’ll just be crisp,” he said, “I like it crisp.” He
shoveled the bacon out on a plate and broke the eggs in the hot grease and they jumped and

fluttered their edges to brown lace and made clucking sounds.
“There was a schoolteacher,” Charles said. “Prettiest thing you ever saw. Had little tiny feet.
Bought all her clothes in New York. Yellow hair, and you never saw such little feet. Sang too, in
the choir. Everybody took to going to church. Damn near stampeded getting into church. That
was quite a while ago.”
“ ’Bout the time you wrote about thinking of getting married?”
Charles grinned. “I guess so. I guess there wasn’t a young buck in the county didn’t get the
marrying fe-ver.”
“What happened to her?”
“Well, you know how it is. The women got kind of restless with her here. They got together. First
thing you knew they had her out. I heard she wore silk underwear. Too hoity toity. School board
had her out halfway through the term. Feet no longer than that. Showed her ankles too, like it was
an accident. Always showing her ankles.”
“Did you get to know her?” Adam asked.
“No. I only went to church. Couldn’t hardly get in. Girl that pretty’s got no right in a little town.
Just makes people uneasy. Causes trouble.”
Adam said, “Remember that Samuels girl? She was real pretty. What happened to her?”
“Same thing. Just caused trouble. She went away. I heard she’s living in Philadelphia. Does
dressmaking. I heard she gets ten dollars just for making one dress.”
“Maybe we ought to go away from here,” Adam said.
Charles said, “Still thinking of California?”
“I guess so.”
Charles’ temper tore in two. “I want you out of here!” he shouted. “I want you to get off the
place. I’ll buy you or sell you or anything. Get out, you son of a bitch—” He stopped. “I guess I
don’t mean that last. But goddam it, you make me nervous.”
“I’ll go,” said Adam.

3
In three months Charles got a colored picture postcard of the bay at Rio, and Adam had written
on the back with a splottery pen, “It’s summer here when it’s winter there. Why don’t you come
down?”
Six months later there was another card, from Buenos Aires. “Dear Charles—my God this is a big
city. They speak French and Spanish both. I’m sending you a book.”
But no book came. Charles looked for it all the following winter and well into the spring. And
instead of the book Adam arrived. He was brown and his clothes had a foreign look.
“How are you?” Charles asked.
“Fine. Did you get the book?”
“No.”
“I wonder what happened to it? It had pictures.”
“Going to stay?”

“I guess so. I’ll tell you about that country.”
“I don’t want to hear about it,” said Charles.
“Christ, you’re mean,” said Adam.
“I can just see it all over again. You’ll stay around a year or so and then you’ll get restless and
you’ll make me restless. We’ll get mad at each other and then we’ll get polite to each other—and
that’s worse. Then we’ll blow up and you’ll go away again, and then you’ll come back and we’ll
do it all over again.”
Adam asked, “Don’t you want me to stay?”
“Hell, yes,” said Charles. “I miss you when you’re not here. But I can see how it’s going to be
just the same.”
And it was just that way. For a while they reviewed old times, for a while they recounted the
times when they were apart, and finally they relapsed into the long ugly silences, the hours of
speechless work, the guarded courtesy, the flashes of anger. There were no bound-aries to time so
that it seemed endless passing.
On an evening Adam said, “You know, I’m going to be thirty-seven. That’s half a life.”
“Here it comes,” said Charles. “Wasting your life. Look, Adam, could we not have a fight this
time?”
“How do you mean?”
“Well, if we run true to form we’ll fight for three or four weeks, getting you ready to go away. If
you’re getting restless, couldn’t you just go away and save all the trouble?”
Adam laughed and the tension went out of the room. “I’ve got a pretty smart brother.” he said.
“Sure, when I get the itch bad enough I’ll go without fighting. Yes, I like that. You’re getting
rich, aren’t you, Charles?”
“I’m doing all right. I wouldn’t say rich.”
“You wouldn’t say you bought four buildings and the inn in the village?”
“No, I wouldn’t say it.”
“But you did. Charles, you’ve made this about the prettiest farm anywhere about. Why don’t we
build a new house—bathtub and running water and a water closet? We’re not poor people any
more. Why, they say you’re nearly the richest man in this section.”
“We don’t need a new house,” Charles said gruffly. “You take your fancy ideas away.”
“It would be nice to go to the toilet without going outside.”
“You take your fancy ideas away.”
Adam was amused. “Maybe I’ll build a pretty little house right over by the woodlot. Say, how
would that be? Then we wouldn’t get on each other’s nerves.”
“I don’t want it on the place.”
“The place is half mine.”
“I’ll buy you out.”
“But I don’t have to sell.”
Charles’ eyes blazed. “I’ll burn your goddam house down.”
“I believe you would,” Adam said, suddenly so-bered. “I believe you really would. What are you

looking like that for?”
Charles said slowly, “I’ve thought about it a lot. And I’ve wanted for you to bring it up. I guess
you aren’t ever going to.”
“What do you mean?”
“You remember when you sent me a telegram for a hundred dollars?”
“You bet I do. Saved my life, I guess. Why?”
“You never paid it back.”
“I must have.”
“You didn’t.”
Adam looked down at the old table where Cyrus had sat, knocking on his wooden leg with a
stick. And the old oil lamp was hanging over the center of the table, shedding its unstable yellow
light from the round Roch-ester wick.
Adam said slowly, “I’ll pay you in the morning.”
“I gave you plenty of time to offer.”
“Sure you did, Charles. I should have remembered.” He paused, considering, and at last he said,
“You don’t know why I needed the money.”
“I never asked.”
“And I never told. Maybe I was ashamed. I was a prisoner, Charles. I broke jail—I escaped.”
Charles’ mouth was open. “What are you talking about?”
“I’m going to tell you. I was a tramp and I got taken up for vagrancy and put on a road gang—leg
irons at night. Got out in six months and picked right up again. That’s how they get their roads
built. I served three days less than the second six months and then I es-caped—got over the
Georgia line, robbed a store for clothes, and sent you the telegram.”
“I don’t believe you,” Charles said. “Yes, I do. You don’t tell lies. Of course I believe you. Why
didn’t you tell me?”
“Maybe I was ashamed. But I’m more ashamed that I didn’t pay you.”
“Oh, forget it,” said Charles. “I don’t know why I mentioned it.”
“Good God, no. I’ll pay you in the morning.”
“I’ll be damned,” said Charles. “My brother a jail-bird!”
“You don’t have to look so happy.”
“I don’t know why,” said Charles, “but it makes me kind of proud. My brother a jailbird! Tell me
this, Adam—why did you wait till just three days before they let you go to make your break?”
Adam smiled. “Two or three reasons,” he said. “I was afraid if I served out my time, why, they’d
pick me up again. And I figured if I waited till the end they wouldn’t expect me to run away.”
“That makes sense,” said Charles. “But you said there was one more reason.”
“I guess the other was the most important,” Adam said, “and it’s the hardest to explain. I figured I
owed the state six months. That was the sentence. I didn’t feel right about cheating. I only
cheated three days.”
Charles exploded with laughter. “You’re a crazy son of a bitch,” he said with affection. “But you
say you robbed a store.”

“I sent the money back with ten per cent interest,” Adam said.
Charles leaned forward. “Tell me about the road gang, Adam.”
“Sure I will, Charles. Sure I will.”

Chapter 11

Charles had more respect for Adam after he knew about the prison. He felt the warmth for his
brother you can feel only for one who is not perfect and therefore no target for your hatred. Adam
took some advantage of it too. He tempted Charles.
“Did you ever think, Charles, that we’ve got enough money to do anything we want to do?”
“All right, what do we want?”
“We could go to Europe, we could walk around Paris.”
“What’s that?”
“What’s what?”
“I thought I heard someone on the stoop.”
“Probably a cat.”
“I guess so. Have to kill off some of them pretty soon.”
“Charles, we could go to Egypt and walk around the Sphinx.”
“We could stay right here and make some good use of our money. And we could get the hell out
to work and make some use of the day. Those goddam cats!” Charles jumped to the door and
yanked it open and said, “Get!” Then he was silent, and Adam saw him staring at the steps. He
moved beside him.
A dirty bundle of rags and mud was trying to worm its way up the steps. One skinny hand clawed
slowly at the stairs. The other dragged helplessly. There was a caked face with cracked lips and
eyes peering out of swollen, blackened lids. The forehead was laid open, oozing blood back into
the matted hair.
Adam went down the stairs and kneeled beside the figure. “Give me a hand,” he said. “Come on,
let’s get her in. Here—look out for that arm. It looks broken.”
She fainted when they carried her in.
“Put her in my bed,” Adam said. “Now I think you better go for the doctor.”
“Don’t you think we better hitch up and take her in?”
“Move her? No. Are you crazy?”
“Maybe not as crazy as you. Think about it a min-ute.”
“For God’s sake, think about what?”
“Two men living alone and they’ve got this in their house.”
Adam was shocked. “You don’t mean it.”
“I mean it all right. I think we better take her in. It’ll be all over the county in two hours. How do
you know what she is? How’d she get here? What happened to her? Adam, you’re taking an
awful chance.”

Adam said coldly, “If you don’t go now, I’ll go and leave you here.”
“I think you’re making a mistake. I’ll go, but I tell you we’ll suffer for it.”
“I’ll do the suffering,” said Adam. “You go.”
After Charles left, Adam went to the kitchen and poured hoi water from the teakettle into a basin.
In his bedroom he dampened a handkerchief in the water and loosened the caked blood and dirt
on the girl’s face. She reeled up to consciousness and her blue eyes glinted at him. His mind went
back—it was this room, this bed. His stepmother was standing over him with a damp cloth in her
hand, and he could feel the little running pains as the water cut through. And she had said
something over and over. He heard it but he could not remember what it was.
“You’ll be all right,” he said to the girl. “We’re getting a doctor. He’ll be here right off.”
Her lips moved a little.
“Don’t try to talk,” he said. “Don’t try to say any-thing.” As he worked gently with his cloth a
huge warmth crept over him. “You can stay here,” he said. “You can stay here as long as you
want. I’ll take care of you.” He squeezed out the cloth and sponged her matted hair and lifted it
out of the gashes in her scalp.
He could hear himself talking as he worked, almost as though he were a stranger listening.
“There, does that hurt? The poor eyes—I’ll put some brown paper over your eyes. You’ll be all
right. That’s a bad one on your forehead. I’m afraid you’ll have a scar there. Could you tell me
your name? No, don’t try. There’s lots of time. There’s lots of time. Do you hear that? That’s the
doctor’s rig. Wasn’t that quick?” He moved to the kitchen door. “In here, Doc. She’s in here,” he
called.

2
She was very badly hurt. If there had been X-rays in that time the doctor might have found more
injuries than he did. As it was he found enough. Her left arm and three ribs were broken and her
jaw was cracked. Her skull was cracked too, and the teeth on the left side were missing. Her scalp
was ripped and torn and her forehead laid open to the skull. So much the doctor could see and
identify. He set her arm, taped her ribs, and sewed up her scalp. With a pipette and an alcohol
flame he bent a glass tube to go through the aperture where a tooth was missing so that she could
drink and take liquid food without moving her cracked jaw. He gave her a large shot of morphine,
left a bottle of opium pills, washed his hands, and put on his coat. His patient was asleep before
he left the room.
In the kitchen he sat down at the table and drank the hot coffee Charles put in front of him.
“All right, what happened to her?” he asked.
“How do we know?” Charles said truculently. “We found her on our porch. If you want to see, go
look at the marks on the road where she dragged herself.”
“Know who she is?”
“God, no.”
“You go upstairs at the inn—is she anybody from there?”
“I haven’t been there lately. I couldn’t recognize her in that condition anyway.”

The doctor turned his head toward Adam. “You ever see her before?”
Adam shook his head slowly.
Charles said harshly, “Say, what you mousing around at?”
“I’ll tell you, since you’re interested. That girl didn’t fall under a harrow even if she looks that
way. Some-body did that to her, somebody who didn’t like her at all. If you want the truth,
somebody tried to kill her.”
“Why don’t you ask her?” Charles said.
“She won’t be talking for quite a while. Besides, her skull is cracked, and God knows what that
will do to her. What I’m getting at is, should I bring the sheriff into it?”
“No!” Adam spoke so explosively that the two looked at him. “Let her alone. Let her rest.”
“Who’s going to take care of her?”
“I am,” said Adam.
“Now, you look here—” Charles began.
“Keep out of it!”
“It’s my place as much as yours.”
“Do you want me to go?”
“I didn’t mean that.”
“Well, I’ll go if she has to go.”
The doctor said, “Steady down. What makes you so interested?”
“I wouldn’t put a hurt dog out.”
“You wouldn’t get mad about it either. Are you holding something back? Did you go out last
night? Did you do it?”
“He was here all night,” said Charles. “He snores like a goddam train.”
Adam said, “Why can’t you let her be? Let her get well.”
The doctor stood up and dusted his hands. “Adam,” he said, “your father was one of my oldest
friends. I know you and your family. You aren’t stupid. I don’t know why you don’t recognize
ordinary facts, but you don’t seem to. Have to talk to you like a baby. That girl was assaulted. I
believe whoever did it tried to kill her. If I don’t tell the sheriff about it, I’m breaking the law. I
admit I break a few, but not that one.”
“Well, tell him. But don’t let him bother her until she’s better.”
“It’s not my habit to let my patients be bothered,” the doctor said. “You still want to keep her
here?”
“Yes.”
“Your funeral. I’ll look in tomorrow. She’ll sleep. Give her water and warm soup through the
tube if she wants it.” He stalked out.
Charles turned on his brother. “Adam, for God’s sake, what is this?”
“Let me alone.”
“What’s got into you?”
“Let me alone—you hear? Just let me alone.”
“Christ!” said Charles and spat on the floor and went restlessly and uneasily to work.

Adam was glad he was gone. He moved about the kitchen, washed the breakfast dishes, and
swept the floor. When he had put the kitchen to rights he went in and drew a chair up to the bed.
The girl snored thickly through the morpnine. The swelling was going down on her face, but the
eyes were blackened and swollen. Adam sat very still, looking at her. Her set and splin-tered arm
lay on her stomach, but her right arm lay on top of the coverlet, the fingers curled like a nest. It
was a child’s hand, almost ä baby’s hand. Adam touched her wrist with his finger, and her fingers
moved a little in reflex. Her wrist was warm. Secretly then, as though he were afraid he might be
caught, he straightened her hand and touched the little cushion pads on the finger-tips. Her
fingers were pink and soft, but the skin on the back of her hand seemed to have an underbloom
like a pearl. Adam chuckled with delight. Her breathing stopped and he became electrically alert
—then her throat clicked and the rhythmed snoring continued. Gently he worked her hand and
arm under the cover before he tiptoed out of the room.
For several days Cathy lay in a cave of shock and opium. Her skin felt like lead, and she moved
very little because of the pain. She was aware of movement around her. Gradually her head and
her eyes cleared. Two young men were with her, one occasionally and the other a great deal. She
knew that another man who came in was the doctor, and there was also a tall lean man, who
interested her more than any of the others, and the interest grew out of fear. Perhaps in her
drugged sleep she had picked something up and stored it.
Very slowly her mind assembled the last days and rearranged them. She saw the face of Mr.
Edwards, saw it lose its placid self-sufficiency and dissolve into mur-der. She had never been so
afraid before in her life, but she had learned fear now. And her mind sniffed about like a rat
looking for an escape. Mr. Edwards knew about the fire. Did anyone else? And how did he
know? A blind nauseating terror rose in her when she thought of that.
From things she heard she learned that the tall man was the sheriff and wanted to question her,
and that the young man named Adam was protecting her from the questioning. Maybe the sheriff
knew about the fire.
Raised voices gave her the cue to her method. The sheriff said, “She must have a name.
Somebody must know her.”
“How could she answer? Her jaw is broken.” Adam’s voice.
“If she’s right-handed she could spell out answers. Look here, Adam, if somebody tried to kill her
I’d better catch him while I can. Just give me a pencil and let me talk to her.”
Adam said, “You heard the doctor say her skull was cracked. How do you know she can
remember?”
“Well, you give me paper and pencil and we’ll see.”
“I don’t want you to bother her.”
“Adam, goddam it, it doesn’t matter what you want. I’m telling you I want a paper and pencil.”
Then the other young man’s voice. “What’s the mat-ter with you? You make it sound like it was
you who did it. Give him a pencil.”
She had her eyes closed when the three men came quietly into her room.
“She’s asleep,” Adam whispered.

She opened her eyes and looked at them.
The tall man came to the side of the bed. “I don’t want to bother you, Miss. I’m the sheriff. I
know you can’t talk, but will you just write some things on this?”
She tried to nod and winced with pain. She blinked her eyes rapidly to indicate assent.
“That’s the girl,” said the sheriff. “You see? She wants to.” He put the tablet on the bed beside
her and molded her fingers around the pencil. “There we are. Now. What is your name?”
The three men watched her face. Her mouth grew thin and her eyes squinted. She closed her eyes
and the pencil began to move. “I don’t know,” it scrawled in huge letters.
“Here, now there’s a fresh sheet. What do you remember?”
“All black. Can’t think,” the pencil wrote before it went over the edge of the tablet.
“Don’t you remember who you are, where you came from? Think!”
She seemed to go through a great struggle and then her face gave up and became tragic. “No.
Mixed up. Help me.”
“Poor child,” the sheriff said. “I thank you for trying anyway. When you get better we’ll try
again. No, you don’t have to write any more.”
The pencil wrote, “Thank you,” and fell from her fingers.
She had won the sheriff. He ranged himself with Adam. Only Charles was against her. When the
brothers were in her room, and it took two of them to help her on the bedpan without hurting her,
she studied Charles’ dark sullenness. He had something in his face that she recognized, that made
her uneasy. She saw that he touched the scar on his forehead very often, rubbed it, and drew its
outline with his fingers. Once he caught her watching. He looked guiltily at his fingers. Charles
said brutally, “Don’t you worry. You’re going to have one like it, maybe even a better one.”
She smiled at him, and he looked away. When Adam came in with her warm soup Charles said,
“I’m going in town and drink some beer.”

3
Adam couldn’t remember ever having been so happy. It didn’t bother him that he did not know
her name. She had said to call her Cathy, and that was enough for him. He cooked for Cathy,
going through recipes used by his mother and his stepmother.
Cathy’s vitality was great. She began to recover very quickly. The swelling went out of her
cheeks and the prettiness of convalescence came to her face. In a short time she could be helped
to a sitting position. She opened and closed her mouth very carefully, and she began to eat soft
foods that required little chewing. The bandage was still on her forehead but the rest of her face
was little marked except for the hollow cheek on the side where the teeth were missing.
Cathy was in trouble and her mind ranged for a way out of it. She spoke little even when it was
not so difficult.
One afternoon she heard someone moving around in the kitchen. She called, “Adam, is it you?”
Charles’ voice answered, “No, it’s me.”
“Would you come in here just a minute, please?”
He stood in the doorway. His eyes were sullen.

“You don’t come in much,” she said.
“That’s right.”
“You don’t like me.”
“I guess that’s right too.”
“Will you tell me why?”
He struggled to find an answer. “I don’t trust you.”
“Why not?”
“I don’t know. And I don’t believe you lost your memory.”
“But why should I lie?”
“I don’t know. That’s why I don’t trust you. There’s something—I almost recognize.”
“You never saw me in your life.”
“Maybe not. But there’s something that bothers me—that I ought to know. And how do you
know I never saw you?”
She was silent, and he moved to leave. “Don’t go,” she said. “What do you intend to do?”
“About what?”
“About me.”
He regarded her with a new interest. “You want the truth?”
“Why else would I ask?”
“I don’t know, but I’ll tell you. I’m going to get you out of here just as soon as I can. My
brother’s turned fool, but I’ll bring him around if I have to lick him.”
“Could you do that? He’s a big man.”
“I could do it.”
She regarded him levelly. “Where is Adam?”
“Gone in town to get some more of your goddam medicine.”
“You’re a mean man.”
“You know what I think? I don’t think I’m half as mean as you are under that nice skin. I think
you’re a devil.”
She laughed softly. “That makes two of us,” she said. “Charles, how long do I have?”
“For what?”
“How long before you put me out? Tell me truly.”
“All right, I will. About a week or ten days. Soon as you can get around.”
“Suppose I don’t go.”
He regarded her craftily, almost with pleasure at the thought of combat. “All right, I’ll tell you.
When you had all that dope you talked a lot, like in your sleep.”
“I don’t believe that.”
He laughed, for he had seen the quick tightening of her mouth. “All right, don’t. And if you just
go about your business as soon as you can, I won’t tell. But if you don’t, you’ll know all right,
and so will the sheriff.”
“I don’t believe I said anything bad. What could I say?”
“I won’t argue with you. And I’ve got work to do. You asked me and I told you.”

He went outside. Back of the henhouse he leaned over and laughed and slapped his leg. “I
thought she was smarter,” he said to himself. And he felt more easy than he had for days.

Charles had frightened her badly. And if he had recog-nized her, so had she recognized him. He
was the only person she had ever met who played it her way. Cathy followed his thinking, and it
did not reassure her. She knew that her tricks would not work with him, and she needed
protection and rest. Her money was gone. She had to be sheltered, and would have to be for a
long time. She was tired and sick, but her mind went skip-ping among possibilities.
Adam came back from town with a bottle of Pain Killer. He poured a tablespoonful. “This will
taste hor-rible,” he said. “It’s good stuff though.”
She took it without protest, did not even make much of a face about it. “You’re good to me,” she
said. “I wonder why? I’ve brought you trouble.”
“You have not. You’ve brightened up the whole house. Never complain or anything, hurt as bad
as you are.”
“You’re so good, so kind.”
“I want to be.”
“Do you have to go out? Couldn’t you stay and talk to me?”
“Sure I could. There’s nothing so important to do.”
“Draw up a chair, Adam, and sit down.”
When he was seated she stretched her right hand toward him, and he took it in both of his. “So
good and kind,” she repeated. “Adam, you keep promises, don’t you?”
“I try to. What are you thinking about?”
“I’m alone and I’m afraid,” she cried. “I’m afraid.”
“Can’t I help you?”
“I don’t think anyone can help me.”
“Tell me and let me try.”
“That’s the worst part. I can’t even tell you.”
“Why not? If it’s a secret I won’t tell it.”
“It’s not my secret, don’t you see?”
“No, I don’t.”
Her fingers gripped his hand tightly. “Adam, I didn’t ever lose my memory.”
“Then why did you say—”
“That’s what I’m trying to tell you. Did you love your father, Adam?”
“I guess I revered him more than loved him.”
“Well, if someone you revered were in trouble, wouldn’t you do anything to save him from
destruc-tion?”
“Well, sure. I guess I would.”
“Well, that’s how it is with me.”
“But how did you get hurt?”

“That’s part of it. That’s why I can’t tell.”
“Was it your father?”
“Oh, no. But it’s all tied up together.”
“You mean, if you tell me who hurt you, then your father will be in trouble?”
She sighed. He would make up the story himself. “Adam, will you trust me?”
“Of course.”
“It’s an awful thing to ask.”
“No, it isn’t, not if you’re protecting your father.”
“You understand, it’s not my secret. If it were I’d tell you in a minute.”
“Of course I understand. I’d do the same thing my-self.”
“Oh, you understand so much.” Tears welled up in her eyes. He leaned down toward her, and she
kissed him on the cheek.
“Don’t you worry,” he said. “I’ll take care of you.”
She lay back against the pillow. “I don’t think you can.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, your brother doesn’t like me. He wants me to get out of here.”
“Did he tell you that?”
“Oh, no. I can just feel it. He hasn’t your under-standing.”
“He has a good heart.”
“I know that, but he doesn’t have your kindness. And when I have to go—the sheriff is going to
begin asking questions and I’ll be all alone.”
He stared into space. “My brother can’t make you go. I own half of this farm. I have my own
money.”
“If he wanted me to go I would have to. I can’t spoil your life.”
Adam stood up and strode out of the room. He went to the back door and looked out on the
afternoon. Far off in the field his brother was lifting stones from a sled and piling them on the
stone wall. Adam looked up at the sky. A blanket of herring clouds was rolling in from the east.
He sighed deeply and his breath made a tickling, exciting feeling in his chest. His ears seemed
suddenly clear, so that he heard the chickens cackling and the east wind blowing over the ground.
He heard horses’ hoofs plodding on the road and far-off pounding on wood where a neighbor was
shingling a barn. And all these sounds related into a kind of music. His eyes were clear too.
Fences and walls and sheds stood staunchly out in the yellow afternoon, and they were related
too. There was change in everything. A flight of sparrows dropped into the dust and scrabbled for
bits of food and then flew off like a gray scarf twisting in the light. Adam looked back at his
brother. He had lost track of time and he did not know how long he had been standing in the
doorway.
No time had passed. Charles was still struggling with the same large stone. And Adam had not
released the full, held breath he had taken when time stopped.
Suddenly he knew joy and sorrow felted into one fabric. Courage and fear were one thing too. He
found that he had started to hum a droning little tune. He turned, walked through the kitchen, and

stood in the doorway, looking at Cathy. She smiled weakly at him, and he thought. What a child!
What a helpless child! and a surge of love filled him.
“Will you marry me?” he asked.
Her face tightened and her hand closed convulsively.
“You don’t have to tell me now,” he said. “I want you to think about it. But if you would marry
me I could protect you. No one could hurt you again.”
Cathy recovered in an instant. “Come here, Adam. There, sit down. Here, give me your hand.
That’s good, that’s right.” She raised his hand and put the back of it against her cheek. “My
dear,” she said brokenly. “Oh, my dear. Look, Adam, you have trusted me. Now will you promise
me something? Will you promise not to tell your brother you have asked me?”
“Asked you to marry me? Why shouldn’t I?”
“It’s not that. I want this night to think. I’ll want maybe more than this night. Could you let me do
that?” She raised her hand to her head. “You know I’m not sure I can think straight. And I want
to.”
“Do you think you might marry me?”
“Please, Adam. Let me alone to think. Please, my dear.”
He smiled and said nervously, “Don’t make it long. I’m kind of like a cat up a tree so far he can’t
come down.”
“Just let me think. And, Adam—you’re a kind man.”
He went outside and walked toward where his broth-er was loading stones.
When he was gone Cathy got up from her bed and moved unsteadily to the bureau. She leaned
forward and looked at her face. The bandage was still on her forehead. She raised the edge of it
enough to see the angry red underneath. She had not only made up her mind to marry Adam but
she had so decided before he had asked her. She was afraid. She needed protection and money.
Adam could give her both. And she could control him—she knew that. She did not want to be
married, but for the time being it was a refuge. Only one thing bothered her. Adam had a warmth
toward her which she did not understand since she had none toward him, nor had ever
experienced it toward any-one. And Mr. Edwards had really frightened her. That had been the
only time in her life she had lost control of a situation. She determined never to let it happen
again. She smiled to herself when she thought what Charles would say. She felt a kinship to
Charles. She didn’t mind his suspicion of her.

5
Charles straightened up when Adam approached. He put his palms against the small of his back
and massaged the tired muscles. “My God, there’s lots of rocks,” he said.
“Fellow in the army told me there’s valleys in Cali-fornia—miles and miles—and you can’t find
a stone, not even a little one.”
“There’ll be something else,” said Charles. “I don’t think there’s any farm without something
wrong with it. Out in the Middle West it’s locusts, someplace else it’s tornadoes. What’s a few
stones?”

“I guess you’re right. I thought I would give you a hand.”
“That’s nice of you. I thought you’d spend the rest of your life holding hands with that in there.
How long is she going to stay?”
Adam was on the point of telling him of his proposal but the tone of Charles’ voice made him
change his mind.
“Say,” Charles said, “Alex Platt came by a little while ago. You’d never think what happened to
him. He’s found a fortune.”
“How do you mean?”
“Well, you know the place on his property where that clump of cedars sticks out—you know,
right on the county road?”
“I know. What about it?”
“Alex went in between those trees and his stone wall. He was hunting rabbits. He found a
suitcase and a man’s clothes, all packed nice. Soaked up with rain though. Looked like it had
been there some time. And there was a wooden box with a lock, and when he broke it open there
was near four thousand dollars in it. And he found a purse too. There wasn’t anything in it.”
“No name or. anything?”
“That’s the strange part—no name; no name on the clothes, no labels on the suits. It’s just like
the fellow didn’t want to be traced.”
“Is Alex going to keep it?”
“He took it in to the sheriff, and the sheriff is going to advertise it, and if nobody answers Alex
can keep it.”
“Somebody’s sure to claim it.”
“I guess so. I didn’t tell Alex that. He’s feeling so good about it. That’s funny about no labels—
not cut out, just didn’t have any.”
“That’s a lot of money,” Adam said. “Somebody’s bound to claim it.”
“Alex hung around for a while. You know, his wife goes around a lot.” Charles was silent.
“Adam,” he said finally, “we got to have a talk. The whole county’s doing plenty of talking.”
“What about? What do you mean?”
“Goddam it, about that—that girl. Two men can’t have a girl living with them. Alex says the
women are pretty riled up about it. Adam, we can’t have it. We live here. We’ve got a good
name.”
“You want me to throw her out before she’s well?”
“I want you to get rid of her—get her out. I don’t like her.”
“You never have.”
“I know it. I don’t trust her. There’s something—something—I don’t know what it is, but I don’t
like it. When you going to get her out?”
“Tell you what,” Adam said slowly. “Give her one more week and then I’ll do something about
her.”
“You promise?”
“Sure I promise.”

“Well, that’s something. I’ll get the word to Alex’s wife. From there on she’ll handle the news.
Good Lord, I’ll be glad to have the house to ourselves again. I don’t suppose her memory’s come
back?”
“No,” said Adam.

6
Five days later, when Charles had gone to buy some calf feed, Adam drove the buggy to the
kitchen steps. He helped Cathy in, tucked a blanket around her knees, and put another around her
shoulders. He drove to the county seat and was married to her by a justice of the peace.
Charles was home when they returned. He looked sourly at them when they came into the
kitchen. “I thought you’d took her in to put her on the train.”
“We got married,” Adam said simply.
Cathy smiled at Charles.
“Why? Why did you do it?”
“Why not? Can’t a man get married?”
Cathy went quickly into the bedroom and closed the door.
Charles began to rave. “She’s no damn good, I tell you. She’s a whore.”
“Charles!”
“I tell you, she’s just a two-bit whore. I wouldn’t trust her with a bit piece—why, that bitch, that
slut!”
“Charles, stop it! Stop it, I tell you! You keep your filthy mouth shut about my wife!”
“She’s no more a wife than an alley cat.”
Adam said slowly, “I think you’re jealous, Charles. I think you wanted to marry her.”
“Why, you goddam fool! Me jealous? I won’t live in the same house with her!”
Adam said evenly, “You won’t have to. I’m going away. You can buy me out if you want. You
can have the farm. You always wanted it. You can stay here and rot.”
Charles’ voice lowered. “Won’t you get rid of her? Please, Adam. Throw her out. She’ll tear you
to pieces. She’ll destroy you, Adam, she’ll destroy you!”
“How do you know so much about her?”
Charles’ eyes were bleak. “I don’t,” he said, and his mouth snapped shut.
Adam did not even ask Cathy whether she wanted to come out for dinner. He carried two plates
into the bedroom and sat beside her.
“We’re going to go away,” he said. “Let me go away. Please, let me. I don’t want to make you
hate your brother. I wonder why he hates me?”
“I think he’s jealous.”
Her eyes narrowed. “Jealous?”
“That’s what it looks like to me. You don’t have to worry. We’re getting out. We’re going to
California.”
She said quietly, “I don’t want to go to California.”
“Nonsense. Why, it’s nice there, sun all the time and beautiful.”

“I don’t want to go to California.”
“You are my wife,” he said softly. “I want you to go with me.”
She was silent and did not speak of it again.
They heard Charles slam out the door, and Adam said, “That will be good for him. He’ll get a
little drunk and he’ll feel better.”
Cathy modestly looked at her fingers. “Adam, I can’t be a wife to you until I’m well.”
“I know,” he said. “I understand. I’ll wait.”
“But I want you to stay with me. I’m afraid of Charles. He hates me so.”
“I’ll bring my cot in here. Then you can call me if you’re frightened. You can reach out and touch
me.”
“You’re so good,” she said. “Could we have some tea?”
“Why, sure, I’d like some myself.” He brought the steaming cups in and went back for the sugar
bowl. He settled himself in a chair near her bed. “It’s pretty strong. Is it too strong for you?”
“I like it strong.”
He finished his cup. “Does it taste strange to you? It’s got a funny taste.”.
Her hand flew to her mouth. “Oh, let me taste it.” She sipped the dregs. “Adam,” she cried, “you
got the wrong cup—that was mine. It had my medicine in it.”
He licked his lips. “I guess it can’t hurt me.”
“No, it can’t.” She laughed softly. “I hope I don’t need to call you in the night.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, you drank my sleeping medicine. Maybe you wouldn’t wake up easily.”
Adam went down into a heavy opium sleep though he fought to stay awake. “Did the doctor tell
you to take this much?” he asked thickly.
“You’re just not used to it,” she said.
Charles came back at eleven o’clock. Cathy heard his tipsy footsteps. He went into his room,
flung off his clothes, and got into bed. He grunted and turned, try-ing to get comfortable, and then
he opened his eyes. Cathy was standing by his bed. “What do you want?”
“What do you think? Move over a little.”
“Where’s Adam?”
“He drank my sleeping medicine by mistake. Move over a little.”
He breathed harshly. “I already been with a whore.”
“You’re a pretty strong boy. Move over a little.”
“How about your broken arm?”
“I’ll take care of that. It’s not your worry.”
Suddenly Charles laughed. “The poor bastard,” he said, and he threw back the blanket to receive
her.

PART TWO

Chapter 12
You can see how this book has reached a great bound-ary that was called 1900. Another hundred
years were ground up and churned, and what had happened was all muddied by the way folks
wanted it to be—more rich and meaningful the farther back it was. In the books of some
memories it was the best time that ever sloshed over the world—the old time, the gay time, sweet
and simple, as though time were young and fearless. Old men who didn’t know whether they
were going to stagger over the boundary of the century looked forward to it with distaste. For the
world was changing, and sweetness was gone, and virtue too. Wor-ry had crept on a corroding
world, and what was lost—good manners, ease and beauty? Ladies were not ladies any more, and
you couldn’t trust a gentleman’s word.
There was a time when people kept their fly buttons fastened. And man’s freedom was boiling
off. And even childhood was no good any more—not the way it was. No worry then but how to
find a good stone, not round exactly but flattened and water-shaped, to use in a sling pouch cut
from a discarded shoe. Where did all the good stones go, and all simplicity?
A man’s mind vagued up a little, for how can you remember the feel of pleasure or pain or
choking emo-tion? You can remember only that you had them. An elder man might truly recall
through water the delicate doctor-testing of little girls, but such a man forgets, and wants to, the
acid emotion eating at the spleen so that a boy had to put his face flat down in the young wild
oats and drum his fists against the ground and sob “Christ! Christ!” Such a man might say, and
did, “What’s that damned kid lying out there in the grass for? He’ll catch a cold.”
Oh, strawberries don’t taste as they used to and the thighs of women have lost their clutch!
And some men eased themselves like setting hens into the nest of death.
History was secreted in the glands of a million histo-rians. We must get out of this banged-up
century, some said, out of this cheating, murderous century of riot and secret death, of scrabbling
for public lands and damn well getting them by any means at all.
Think back, recall our little nation fringing the oceans, torn with complexities, too big for its
britches. Just got going when the British took us on again. We beat them, but it didn’t do us much
good. What we had was a burned White House and ten thousand wid-ows on the public pension
list.
Then the soldiers went to Mexico and it was a kind of painful picnic. Nobody knows why you go
to a picnic to be uncomfortable when it is so easy and pleasant to eat at home. The Mexican War
did two good things though. We got a lot of western land, damn near doubled our size, and
besides that it was a training ground for generals, so that when the sad self-murder settled on us
the leaders knew the techniques for making it properly horrible.
And then the arguments:
Can you keep a slave?

Well if you bought him in good faith, why not?
Next they’ll be saying a man can’t have a horse. Who is it wants to take my property?
And there we were, like a man scratching at his own face and bleeding into his own beard.
Well, that was over and we got slowly up off the bloody ground and started westward.
There came boom and bust, bankruptcy, depression.
Great public thieves came along and picked the pockets of everyone who had a pocket.
To hell with that rotten century!
Let’s get it over and the door closed shut on it! Let’s close it like a book and go on reading! New
chapter, new life. A man will have clean hands once we get the lid slammed shut on that stinking
century. It’s a fair thing ahead. There’s no rot on this clean new hundred years. It’s not stacked,
and any bastard who deals seconds from this new deck of years—why, we’ll cruci-fy him head
down over a privy.
Oh, but strawberries will never taste so good again and the thighs of women have lost their clutch!

Chapter 13
1
Sometimes a kind of glory lights up the mind of a man. It happens to nearly everyone. You can
feel it growing or preparing like a fuse burning toward dynamite. It is a feeling in the stomach, a
delight of the nerves, of the forearms. The skin tastes the air, and every deep-drawn breath is
sweet. Its beginning has the pleasure of a great stretching yawn; it flashes in the brain and the
whole world glows outside your eyes. A man may have lived all of his life in the gray, and the
land and trees of him dark and somber. The events, even the important ones, may have trooped by
faceless and pale. And then—the glory—so that a cricket song sweetens his ears, the smell of the
earth rises chanting to his nose, and dappling light under a tree blesses his eyes. Then a man
pours outward, a torrent of him, and yet he is not diminished. And I guess a man’s importance in
the world can be measured by the quality and number of his glories. It is a lonely thing but it
relates us to the world. It is the mother of all creativeness, and it sets each man separate from all
other men.
I don’t know how it will be in the years to come. There are monstrous changes taking place in the
world, forces shaping a future whose face we do not know. Some of these forces seem evil to us,
perhaps not in themselves but because their tendency is to eliminate other things we hold good. It
is true that two men can lift a bigger stone than one man. A group can build automobiles quicker
and better than one man, and bread from a huge factory is cheaper and more uni-form. When our
food and clothing and housing all are born in the complication of mass production, mass method
is bound to get into our thinking and to elimi-nate all other thinking. In our time mass or
collective production has entered our economics, our politics, and even our religion, so that some
nations have substituted the idea collective for the idea God. This in my time is the danger. There
is great tension in the world, tension toward a breaking point, and men are unhappy and confused.
At such a time it seems natural and good to me to ask myself these questions. What do I believe
in? What must I fight for and what must I fight against?
Our species is the only creative species, and it has only one creative instrument, the individual
mind and spirit of a man. Nothing was ever created by two men. There are no good
collaborations, whether in music, in art, in poetry, in mathematics, in philosophy. Once the
miracle of creation has taken place, the group can build and extend it, but the group never invents
anything. The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man.
And now the forces marshaled around the concept of the group have declared a war of
extermination on that preciousness, the mind of man. By disparagement, by starvation, by
repressions, forced direction, and the stunning hammerblows of conditioning, the free, roving
mind is being pursued, roped, blunted, drugged. It is a sad suicidal course our species seems to

have taken.
And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable
thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it
wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or govern-ment which limits
or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about. I can understand why a system
built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind, for this is one thing which can by inspection
destroy such a system. Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to
preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts. If the glory can be killed, we
are lost.

2
Adam Trask grew up in grayness, and the curtains of his life were like dusty cobwebs, and his
days a slow file of half-sorrows and sick dissatisfactions, and then, through Cathy, the glory came
to him.
It doesn’t matter that Cathy was what I have called a monster. Perhaps we can’t understand
Cathy, but on the other hand we are capable of many things in all directions, of great virtues and
great sins. And who in his mind has not probed the black water?
Maybe we all have in us a secret pond where evil and ugly things germinate and grow strong. But
this culture is fenced, and the swimming brood climbs up only to fall back. Might it not be that in
the dark pools of some men the evil grows strong enough to wriggle over the fence and swim
free? Would not such a man be our monster, and are we not related to him in our hidden water? It
would be absurd if we did not understand both angels and devils, since we invented them.
Whatever Cathy may have been, she set off the glory in Adam. His spirit rose flying and released
him from fear and bitterness and rancid memories. The glory lights up the world and changes it
the way a star shell changes a battleground. Perhaps Adam did not see Cathy at all, so lighted was
she by his eyes. Burned in his mind was an image of beauty and tenderness, a sweet and holy girl,
precious beyond thinking, clean and loving, and that image was Cathy to her husband, and
nothing Cathy did or said could warp Adam’s Cathy.
She said she did not want to go to California and he did not listen, because his Cathy took his arm
and started first. So bright was his glory that he did not notice the sullen pain in his brother, did
not see the glinting in his brother’s eyes. He sold his share of the farm to Charles, for less than it
was worth, and with that and his half of his father’s money he was free and rich.
The brothers were strangers now. They shook hands at the station, and Charles watched the train
pull out and rubbed his scar. He went to the inn, drank four quick whiskies, and climbed the stairs
to the top floor. He paid the girl and then could not perform. He cried in her arms until she put
him out. He raged at his farm, forced it, added to it, drilled and trimmed, and his boundaries
extended. He took no rest, no recreation, and he became rich without pleasure and respected
without friends.
Adam stopped in New York long enough to buy clothes for himself and Cathy before they
climbed on the train which bore them across the continent. How they happened to go to the

Salinas Valley is very easy to understand.
In that day the railroads—growing, fighting among themselves, striving to increase and to
dominate—used every means to increase their traffic. The companies not only advertised in the
newspapers, they issued book-lets and broadsides describing and picturing the beauty and
richness of the West. No claim was too extravagant—wealth was unlimited. The Southern Pacific
Rail-road, headed by the wild energy of Leland Stanford, had begun to dominate the Pacific
Coast not only in transportation but in politics. Its rails extended down the valleys. New towns
sprang up, new sections were opened and populated, for the company had to create customers to
get custom.
The long Salinas Valley was part of the exploitation. Adam had seen and studied a fine color
broadside which set forth the valley as that region which heaven unsuccessfully imitated. After
reading the literature, anyone who did not want to settle in the Salinas Valley was crazy.
Adam did not rush at his purchase. He bought a rig and drove around, meeting the earlier comers,
talking of soil and water, climate and crops, prices and facili-ties. It was not speculation with
Adam. He was here to settle, to found a home, a family, perhaps a dynasty.
Adam drove exuberantly from farm to farm, picked up dirt and crumbled it in his fingers, talked
and planned and dreamed. The people of the valley liked him and were glad he had come to live
there, for they recognized a man of substance.
He had only one worry, and that was for Cathy. She was not well. She rode around the country
with him, but she was listless. One morning she complained of feeling ill and stayed in her room
in the King City hotel while Adam drove into the country. He returned at about five in the
afternoon to find her nearly dead from loss of blood. Luckily Adam found Dr. Tilson at his
supper and dragged him from his roast beef. The doc-tor made a quick examination, inserted a
packing, and turned to Adam.
“Why don’t you wait downstairs?” he suggested.
“Is she all right?”
“Yes. I’ll call you pretty soon.”
Adam patted Cathy’s shoulder, and she smiled up at him.
Dr. Tilson closed the door behind him and came back to the bed. His face was red with anger.
“Why did you do it?”
Cathy’s mouth was a thin tight line.
“Does your husband know you are pregnant?”
Her head moved slowly from side to side.
“What did you do it with?”
She stared up at him.
He looked around the room. He stepped to the bu-reau and picked up a knitting needle. He shook
it in her face. “The old offender—the old criminal,” he said. “You’re a fool. You’ve nearly killed
yourself and you haven’t lost your baby. I suppose you took things too, poisoned yourself,
inserted camphor, kerosene, red pep-per. My God! Some of the things you women do!”
Her eyes were as cold as glass.

He pulled a chair up beside her bed. “Why don’t you want to have the baby?” he asked softly.
“You’ve got a good husband. Don’t you love him? Don’t you intend to speak to me at all? Tell
me, damn it! Don’t turn mulish.”
Her lips did not move and her eyes did not flicker.
“My dear,” he said, “can’t you see? You must not destroy life. That’s the one thing gets me crazy.
God knows I lose patients because I don’t know enough. But I try—I always try. And then I see a
deliberate kill-ing.” He talked rapidly on. He dreaded the sick silence between his sentences. This
woman puzzled him. There was something inhuman about her. “Have you met Mrs. Laurel?
She’s wasting and crying for a baby. Everything she has or can get she would give to have a
baby, and you—you try to stab yours with a knitting needle. All right,” he cried, “you won’t speak
—you don’t have to. But I’m going to tell you. The baby is safe. Your aim was bad. And I’m
telling you this—you’re going to have that baby. Do you know what the law in this state has to
say about abortion? You don’t have to answer, but you listen to me! If this happens again, if you
lose this baby and I have any reason to suspect monkey business, I will charge you, I will testify
against you, and I will see you punished. Now I hope you have sense enough to believe me,
because I mean it.”
Cathy moistened her lips with a little pointed tongue. The cold went out of her eyes and a weak
sadness took its place. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I’m sorry. But you don’t understand.”
“Then why don’t you tell me?” His anger disappeared like mist. “Tell me, my dear.”
“It’s hard to tell. Adam is so good, so strong. I am—well, I’m tainted. Epilepsy.”
“Not you!”
“No, but my grandfather and my father—and my brother.” She covered her eyes with her hands.
“I couldn’t bring that to my husband.”
“Poor child,” he said. “My poor child. You can’t be certain. It’s more than probable that your
baby will be fine and healthy. Will you promise me not to try any more tricks?”
“Yes.”
“All right then. I won’t tell your husband what you did. Now lie back and let me see if the
bleeding’s stopped.”
In a few minutes he closed his satchel and put the knitting needle in his pocket. “I’ll look in
tomorrow morning,” he said.
Adam swarmed on him as he came down the narrow stairs into the lobby. Dr. Tilson warded off a
flurry of “How is she? Is she all right? What caused it? Can I go up?”
“Whoa, hold up—hold up.” And he used his trick, his standard joke. “Your wife is sick.”
“Doctor—”
“She has the only good sickness there is—”
“Doctor—”
“Your wife is going to have a baby.” He brushed past Adam and left him staring. Three men
sitting around the stove grinned at him. One of them observed dryly, “If it was me now—why,
I’d invite a few, maybe three, friends to have a drink.” His hint was wasted. Adam bolted
clumsily up the narrow stairs.

Adam’s attention narrowed to the Bordoni ranch a few miles south of King City, almost
equidistant, in fact, between San Lucas and King City.
The Bordonis had nine hundred acres left of a grant of ten thousand acres which had come to
Mrs. Bordoni’s great-grandfather from the Spanish crown. The Bordonis were Swiss, but Mrs.
Bordoni was the daugh-ter and heiress of a Spanish family that had settled in the Salinas Valley
in very early times. And as hap-pened with most of the old families, the land slipped away. Some
was lost in gambling, some chipped off for taxes, and some acres torn off like coupons to buy
luxuries—a horse, a diamond, or a pretty woman. The nine hundred remaining acres were the
core of the original Sanchez grant, and the best of it too. They straddled the river and tucked into
the foothills on both sides, for at this point the valley narrows and then opens out again. The
original Sanchez house was still usable. Built of adobe, it stood in a tiny opening in the foothills,
a miniature valley fed by a precious ever-running spring of sweet water. That of course was why
the first Sanchez had built his seat there. Huge live oaks shaded the valley, and the earth had a
richness and a greenness foreign to this part of the country. The walls of the low house were four
feet thick, and the round pole rafters were tied on with rawhide ropes which had been put on wet.
The hide shrank and pulled joist and rafter tight together, and the leather ropes became hard as
iron and nearly imperishable. There is only one drawback to this building method. Rats will gnaw
at the hide if they are let.
The old house seemed to have grown out of the earth, and it was lovely. Bordoni used it for a cow
barn. He was a Swiss, an immigrant, with his national passion for cleanliness. He distrusted the
thick mud walls and built a frame house some distance away, and his cows put their heads out the
deep recessed windows of the old Sanchez house.
The Bordonis were childless, and when the wife died in ripe years a lonely longing for his Alpine
past fell on her husband. He wanted to sell the ranch and go home. Adam Trask refused to buy in
a hurry, and Bordoni was asking a big price and using the selling method of pretending not to
care whether he sold or not. Bordoni knew Adam was going to buy his land long before Adam
knew it.
Where Adam settled he intended to stay and to have his unborn children stay. He was afraid he
might buy one place and then see another he liked better, and all the time the Sanchez place was
drawing him. With the advent of Cathy, his life extended long and pleasantly ahead of him. But
he went through all the motions of carefulness. He drove and rode and walked over every foot of
the land. He put a post-hole auger down through the subsoil to test and feel and smell the under
earth. He inquired about the small wild plants of field and riverside and hill. In damp places he
knelt down and examined the game tracks in the mud, mountain lion and deer, coyote and wild
cat, skunk and raccoon, weasel and rabbit, all overlaid with the pattern of quail tracks. He
threaded among willows and sycamores and wild blackberry vines in the riverbed, patted the
trunks of live oak and scrub oak, madrone, laurel, toyon.
Bordoni watched him with squinting eyes and poured tumblers of red wine squeezed from the
grapes of his small hillside vineyard. It was Bordoni’s pleasure to get a little drunk every
afternoon. And Adam, who had never tasted wine, began to like it.

Over and over he asked Cathy’s opinion of the place. Did she like it? Would she be happy there?
And he didn’t listen to her noncommittal answers. He thought that she linked arms with his
enthusiasm. In the lobby of the King City hotel he talked to the men who gath-ered around the
stove and read the papers sent down from San Francisco.
“It’s water I think about,” he said one evening. “I wonder how deep you’d have to go to bring in a
well.”
A rancher crossed his denim knees. “You ought to go see Sam Hamilton,” he said. “He knows
more about water than anybody around here. He’s a water witch and a well-digger too. He’ll tell
you. He’s put down half the wells in this part of the valley.”
His companion chuckled. “Sam’s got a real legitimate reason to be interested in water. Hasn’t got
a goddam drop of it on his own place.”
“How do I find him?” Adam asked.
“I’ll tell you what. I’m going out to have him make some angle irons. I’ll take you with me if you
want. You’ll like Mr. Hamilton. He’s a fine man.”
“Kind of a comical genius,” his companion said.

They went to the Hamilton ranch in Louis Lippo’s buckboard—Louis and Adam Trask. The iron
straps rattled around in the box, and a leg of venison, wrapped in wet burlap to keep it cool,
jumped around on top of the iron. It was customary in that day to take some substantial lump of
food as a present when you went calling on a man, for you had to stay to dinner unless you
wished to insult his house. But a few guests could set back the feeding plans for the week if you
did not build up what you destroyed. A quarter of pork or a rump of beef would do. Louis had cut
down the venison and Adam provided a bottle of whisky.
“Now I’ll have to tell you,” Louis said. “Mr. Hamil-ton will like that, but Mrs. Hamilton has got a
skunner on it. If I was you I’d leave it under the seat, and when we drive around to the shop, why,
then you can get it out. That’s what we always do.”
“Doesn’t she let her husband take a drink?”
“No bigger than a bird,” said Louis. “But she’s got brassbound opinions. Just you leave the bottle
under the seat.”
They left the valley road and drove into the worn and rutted hills over a set of wheel tracks
gulleyed by the winter rains. The horses strained into their collars and the buckboard rocked and
swayed. The year had not been kind to the hills, and already in June they were dry and the stones
showed through the short, burned feed. The wild oats had headed out barely six inches above the
ground, as though with knowledge that if they didn’t make seed quickly they wouldn’t get to seed
at all.
“It’s not likely looking country,” Adam said.
“Likely? Why, Mr. Trask, it’s country that will break a man’s heart and eat him up. Likely! Mr.
Hamilton has a sizable piece and he’d of starved to death on it with all those children. The ranch
don’t feed them. He does all kinds of jobs, and his boys are starting to bring in something now.

It’s a fine family.”
Adam stared at a line of dark mesquite that peeked out of a draw. “Why in the world would he
settle on a place like this?”
Louis Lippo, as does every man, loved to interpret, to a stranger particularly, if no native was
present to put up an argument. “I’ll tell you,” he said. “Take me—my father was Italian. Came
here after the trouble but he brought a little money. My place isn’t very big but it’s nice. My
father bought it. He picked it out. And take you—I don’t know how you’re fixed and wouldn’t
ask, but they say you’re trying to buy the old Sanchez place and Bordoni never gave anything
away. You’re pretty well fixed or you couldn’t even ask about it.”
“I’m comfortably off,” said Adam modestly.
“I’m talking the long way around,” said Louis. “When Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton came into the
valley they didn’t have a pot to piss in. They had to take what was left—government land that
nobody else wanted. Twenty-five acres of it won’t keep a cow alive even in good years, and they
say the coyotes move away in bad years. There’s people say they don’t know how the Hamiltons
lived. But of course Mr. Hamilton went right to work—that’s how they lived. Worked as a hired
hand till he got his threshing machine built.”
“Must have made a go of it. I hear of him all over.”
“He made a go of it all right. Raised nine children. I’ll bet he hasn’t got four bits laid away. How
could he?”
One side of the buckboard leaped up, rolled over a big round stone, and dropped down again. The
horses were dark with sweat and lathered under the collar and britching.
“I’ll be glad to talk to him,” said Adam.
“Well, sir, he raised one fine crop—he had good children and he raised them fine. All doing well
—maybe except Joe. Joe—he’s the youngest—they’re talking about sending him to college, but
all the rest are doing fine. Mr. Hamilton can be proud. The house is just on the other side of the
next rise. Don’t forget and bring out that whisky—she’ll freeze you to the ground.”
The dry earth was ticking under the sun and the crickets rasped. “It’s real godforsaken country,”
said Louis.
“Makes me feel mean,” said Adam.
“How’s that?”
“Well, I’m fixed so I don’t have to live on a place like this.”
“Me too, and I don’t feel mean. I’m just goddam glad.”
When the buckboard topped the rise Adam could look down on the little cluster of buildings
which com-posed the Hamilton seat—a house with many lean-tos, a cow shed, a shop, and a
wagon shed. It was a dry and sun-eaten sight—no big trees and a small hand-watered garden.
Louis turned to Adam, and there was just a hint of hostility in his tone. “I want to put you straight
on one or two things, Mr. Trask. There’s people that when they see Samuel Hamilton the first
time might get the idea he’s full of bull. He don’t talk like other people. He’s an Irishman. And
he’s all full of plans—a hun-dred plans a day. And he’s all full of hope. My Christ, he’d have to
be to live on this land! But you remember this—he’s a fine worker, a good blacksmith, and some

of his plans work out. And I’ve heard him talk about things that were going to happen and they
did.”
Adam was alarmed at the hint of threat. “I’m not a man to run another man down,” he said, and
he felt that suddenly Louis thought of him as a stranger and an enemy.
“I just wanted you to get it straight. There’s some people come in from the East and they think if
a man hasn’t got a lot of money he’s no good.”
“I wouldn’t think of—”
“Mr. Hamilton maybe hasn’t got four bits put away, but he’s our people and he’s as good as we
got. And he’s raised the nicest family you’re likely to see. I just want you to remember that.”
Adam was on the point of defending himself and then he said, “I’ll remember. Thanks for telling
me.”
Louis faced around front again. “There he is—see, out by the shop? He must of heard us.”
“Has he got a beard?” Adam asked, peering.
“Yes, got a nice beard. It’s turning white fast, begin-ning to grizzle up.”
They drove past the frame house and saw Mrs. Hamilton looking out the window at them, and
they drew up in front of the shop where Samuel stood waiting for them.
Adam saw a big man, bearded like a patriarch, his graying hair stirring in the air like thistledown.
His cheeks above his beard were pink where the sun had burned his Irish skin. He wore a clean
blue shirt, overalls, and a leather apron. His sleeves were rolled up, and his muscular arms were
clean too. Only his hands were blackened from the forge. After a quick glance Adam came back
to the eyes, light blue and filled with a young delight. The wrinkles around them were drawn in
radial lines inward by laughter.
“Louis,” he said, “I’m glad to see you. Even in the sweetness of our little heaven here, we like to
see our friends.” He smiled at Adam, and Louis said, “I brought Mr. Adam Trask to see you. He’s
a stranger from down east, come to settle.”
“I’m glad,” said Samuel. “We’ll shake another time. I wouldn’t soil your hand with these forge
hooks.”
“I brought some strap iron, Mr. Hamilton. Would you make some angles for me? The whole
frame of my header bed is fallen to hell.”
“Sure I will, Louis. Get down, get down. We’ll put the horses to the shade.”
“There’s a piece of venison behind, and Mr. Trask brought a little something.”
Samuel glanced toward the house. “Maybe we’ll get out the ‘little something’ when we’ve got the
rig behind the shed.”
Adam could hear the singing lilt of his speech and yet could detect no word pronounced in a
strange manner except perhaps in sharpened i’s and l’s held high on the tongue.
“Louis, will you out-span your team? I’ll take the vension in. Liza will be glad. She likes a
venison stew.”
“Any of the young ones home?”
“Well, no, they aren’t. George and Will came home for the week-end, and they all went last night
to a dance up Wild Horse Canyon at the Peach Tree school-house. They’ll come trooping back by

dusk. We lack a sofa because of that. I’ll tell you later—Liza will have a vengeance on them—it
was Tom did it. I’ll tell you later.” He laughed and started toward the house, carry-ing the
wrapped deer’s haunch. “If you want you can bring the ‘little something’ into the shop, so you
don’t let the sun glint on it.”
They heard him calling as he came near the house. “Liza, you’ll never guess. Louis Lippo has
brought a piece of venison bigger than you.”
Louis drove in back of the shed, and Adam helped him take the horses out, tie up the tugs, and
halter them in the shade. “He meant that about the sun shining on the bottle,” said Louis.
“She must be a holy terror.”
“No bigger than a bird but she’s brassbound.”
“ ‘Out-span,’ ” Adam said. “I think I’ve heard it said that way, or read it.”
Samuel rejoined them in the shop. “Liza will be happy if you will stay to dinner,” he said.
“She didn’t expect us,” Adam protested.
“Hush, man. She’ll make some extra dumplings for the stew. It’s a pleasure to have you here.
Give me your straps, Louis, and let’s see how you want them.”
He built a chip fire in the black square of the forge and pulled a bellows breeze on it and then fed
wet coke over with his fingers until it glowed. “Here, Louis,” he said, “wave your wing on my
fire. Slow, man, slow and even.” He laid the strips of iron on the glowing coke. “No, sir, Mr.
Trask, Liza’s used to cooking for nine starving children. Nothing can startle her.” He tongued the
iron to more advantageous heat, and he laughed. “I’ll take that last back as a holy lie,” he said.
“My wife is rumbling like round stones in the surf. And I’ll caution the both of you not to
mention the word ‘sofa.’ It’s a word of anger and sorrow to Liza.”
“You said something about it,” Adam said.
“If you knew my boy Tom, you’d understand it better, Mr. Trask. Louis knows him.”
“Sure I know him,” Louis said.
Samuel went on, “My Tom is a hell-bent boy. Al-ways takes more on his plate than he can eat.
Always plants more than he can harvest. Pleasures too much, sorrows too much. Some people are
like that. Liza thinks I’m like that. I don’t know what will come to Tom. Maybe greatness, maybe
the noose—well, Hamiltons have been hanged before. And I’ll tell you about that sometime.”
“The sofa,” Adam suggested politely.
“You’re right. I do, and Liza says I do, shepherd my words like rebellious sheep. Well, came the
dance at the Peach Tree school and the boys, George, Tom, Will, and Joe, all decided to go. And
of course the girls were asked. George and Will and Joe, poor simple boys, each asked one lady
friend, but Tom—he took too big a helping as usual. He asked two Williams sisters, Jennie and
Belle. How many screw holes do you want, Louis?”
“Five,” said Louis.
“All right. Now I must tell you, Mr. Trask, that my Tom has all the egotism and self-love of a
boy who thinks he’s ugly. Mostly lets himself go fallow, but comes a celebration and he garlands
himself like a maypole, and he glories like spring flowers. This takes him quite a piece of time.
You notice the wagon house was empty? George and Will and Joe started early and not so

beautiful as Tom. George took the rig, Will had the buggy, and Joe got the little two-wheeled
cart.” Samuel’s blue eyes shone with pleasure. “Well then, Tom came out as shy and shining as a
Roman emperor and the only thing left with wheels was a hay rake, and you can’t take even one
Williams sister on that. For good or bad, Liza was taking her nap. Tom sat on the steps and
thought it out. Then I saw him go to the shed and hitch up two horses and take the doubletree off
the hay rake. He wrestled the sofa out of the house and ran a fifth-chain under the legs—the fine
goose-neck horsehair sofa that Liza loves better than anything. I gave it to her to rest on before
George was born. The last I saw, Tom went dragging up the hill, reclining at his ease on the sofa
to get the Williams girls. And, oh, Lord, it’ll be worn thin as a wafer from scraping by the time he
gets it back.” Samuel put down his tongs and placed his hands on his hips the better to laugh.
“And Liza has the smoke of brimstone coming out her nos-trils. Poor Tom.”
Adam said, smiling, “Would you like to take a little something?”
“That I would,” said Samuel. He accepted the bottle and took a quick swallow of whisky and
passed it back.
“Uisquebaugh—it’s an Irish word—whisky, water of life—and so it is.”
He took the red straps to his anvil and punched screw holes in them and bent the angles with his
ham-mer and the forked sparks leaped out. Then he dipped the iron hissing into his half-barrel of
black water. “There you are,” he said and threw them on the ground.
“I thank you,” said Louis. “How much will that be?”
“The pleasure of your company.”
“It’s always like that,” Louis said helplessly.
“No, when I put your new well down you paid my price.”
“That reminds me—Mr. Trask here is thinking of buying the Bordoni place—the old Sanchez
grant—you remember?”
“I know it well,” said Samuel. “It’s a fine piece.”
“He was asking about water, and I told him you knew more about that than anybody around here.”
Adam passed the bottle, and Samuel took a delicate sip and wiped his mouth on his forearm
above the soot.
“I haven’t made up my mind,” said Adam. “I’m just asking some questions.”
“Oh, Lord, man, now you’ve put your foot in it. They say it’s a dangerous thing to question an
Irishman because he’ll tell you. I hope you know what you’re doing when you issue me a license
to talk. I’ve heard two ways of looking at it. One says the silent man is the wise man and the
other that a man without words is a man without thought. Naturally I favor the second—Liza says
to a fault. What do you want to know?”
“Well, take the Bordoni place. How deep would you have to go to get water?”
“I’d have to see the spot—some places thirty feet, some places a hundred and fifty, and in some
places clear to the center of the world.”
“But you could develop water?”
“Nearly every place except my own.”
“I’ve heard you have a lack here.”

“Heard? Why, God in heaven must have heard! I’ve screamed it loud enough.”
“There’s a four-hundred-acre piece beside the river. Would there be water under it?”
“I’d have to look. It seems to me it’s an odd valley. If you’ll hold your patience close, maybe I
can tell you a little bit about it, for I’ve looked at it and poked my stinger down into it. A hungry
man gorges with his mind—he does indeed.”
Louis Lippo said, “Mr. Trask is from New England. He plans to settle here. He’s been west
before though—in the army, fighting Indians.”
“Were you now? Then it’s you should talk and let me learn.”
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Why not? God help my family and my neighbors if I had fought the Indians!”
“I didn’t want to fight them, sir.” The “sir” crept in without his knowing it.
“Yes, I can understand that. It must be a hard thing to kill a man you don’t know and don’t hate.”
“Maybe that makes it easier,” said Louis.
“You have a point, Louis. But some men are friends with the whole world in their hearts, and
there are others that hate themselves and spread their hatred around like butter on hot bread.”
“I’d rather you told me about this land,” Adam said uneasily, for a sick picture of piled-up bodies
came into his mind.
“What time is it?”
Louis stepped out and looked at the sun. “Not past ten o’clock.”
“If I get started I have no self-control. My son Will says I talk to trees when I can’t find a human
vegeta-ble.” He sighed and sat down on a nail keg. “I said it was a strange valley, but maybe
that’s because I was born in a green place. Do you find it strange, Louis?”
“No, I never been out of it.”
“I’ve dug into it plenty,” Samuel said. “Something went on under it—maybe still is going on.
There’s an ocean bed underneath, and below that another world. But that needn’t bother a
farming man. Now, on top is good soil, particularly on the flats. In the upper valley it is light and
sandy, but mixed in with that, the top sweetness of the hills that washed down on it in the winters.
As you go north the valley widens out, and the soil gets blacker and heavier and perhaps richer.
It’s my belief that marshes were there once, and the roots of centuries rotted into the soil and
made it black and fertilized it. And when you turn it up, a little greasy clay mixes and holds it
together. That’s from about Gonzales north to the river mouth. Off to the sides, around Salinas
and Blanco and Castroville and Moss Landing, the marshes are still there. And when one day
those marshes are drained off, that will be the richest of all land in this red world.”
“He always tells what it will be like someday,” Louis threw in.
“Well, a man’s mind can’t stay in time the way his body does.”
“If I’m going to settle here I need to know about how and what will be,” said Adam. “My
children, when I have them, will be on it.”
Samuel’s eyes looked over the heads of his friends, out of the dark forge to the yellow sunlight.
“You’ll have to know that under a good part of the valley, some places deep and others pretty
near the surface, there’s a layer called hard-pan. It’s a clay, hard-packed, and it feels greasy too.

Some places it is only a foot thick, and more in others. And this hard-pan resists water. If it were
not there the winter rains would go soaking down and dampen the earth, and in the summer it
would rise up to the roots again. But when the earth above the hard-pan is soaked full, the rest
runs fresheting off or stands rotting on top. And that’s one of the main curses of our valley.”
“Well, it’s a pretty good place to live, isn’t it?”
“Yes, it is, but a man can’t entirely rest when he knows it could be richer. I’ve thought that if you
could drive thousands of holes through it to let the water in, it might solve it. And then I tried
something with a few sticks of dynamite. I punched a hole through the hard-pan and blasted. That
broke it up and the water could get down. But, God in heaven, think of the amount of dynamite!
I’ve read that a Swede—the same man who invented dynamite—has got a new explosive stronger
and safer Maybe that might be the answer.”
Louis said half derisively and half with admiration, “He’s always thinking about how to change
things. He’s never satisfied with the way they are.”
Samuel smiled at him. “They say men lived in trees one time. Somebody had to get dissatisfied
with a high limb or your feet would not be touching flat ground now.” And then he laughed
again. “I can see myself sitting on my dust heap making a world in my mind as surely as God
created this one. But God saw this world. I’ll never see mine except—this way. This will be a
valley of great richness one day. It could feed the world, and maybe it will. And happy people
will live here, thousands and thousands—” A cloud seemed to come over his eyes and his face set
in sadness and he was silent.
“You make it sound like a good place to settle,” Adam said. “Where else could I raise my
children with that coming?”
Samuel went on, “There’s one thing I don’t under-stand. There’s a blackness on this valley. I
don’t know what it is, but I can feel it. Sometimes on a white blinding day I can feel it cutting off
the sun and squeezing the light out of it like a sponge.” His voice rose. “There’s a black violence
on this valley. I don’t know—I don’t know. It’s as though some old ghost haunted it out of the
dead ocean below and troubled the air with unhappiness. It’s as secret as hidden sor-row. I don’t
know what it is, but I see it and feel it in the people here.”
Adam shivered. “I just remembered I promised to get back early. Cathy, my wife, is going to
have a baby.”
“But Liza’s getting ready.”
“She’ll understand when you tell her about the baby. My wife is feeling poorly. And I thank you
for telling me about the water.”
“Have I depressed you with my rambling?”
“No, not at all—not at all. It’s Cathy’s first baby and she’s miserable.”
Adam struggled all night with his thoughts and the next day he drove out and shook hands with
Bordoni and the Sanchez place was his.

Chapter 14
1
There is so much to tell about the Western country in that day that it is hard to know where to
start. One thing sets off a hundred others. The problem is to decide which one to tell first.
You remember that Samuel Hamilton said his chil-dren had gone to a dance at the Peach Tree
School. The country schools were the centers of culture then. The Protestant churches in the
towns were fighting for their existence in a country where they were new-comers. The Catholic
church, first on the scene and deeply dug in, sat in comfortable tradition while the missions were
gradually abandoned and their roofs fell in and pigeons roosted on the stripped altars. The library
(in Latin and Spanish) of the San Antonio Mission was thrown into a granary, where the rats ate
off the sheepskin bindings. In the country the reposito-ry of art and science was the school, and
the school-teacher shielded and carried the torch of learning and of beauty. The schoolhouse was
the meeting place for music, for debate. The polls were set in the schoolhouse for elections.
Social life, whether it was the crowning of a May queen, the eulogy to a dead president, or an allnight dance, could be held nowhere else. And the teacher was not only an intellectual paragon
and a social leader, but also the matrimonial catch of the countryside. A family could indeed walk
proudly if a son married the schoolteacher. Her children were pre-sumed to have intellectual
advantages both inherited and conditioned.
The daughters of Samuel Hamilton were not destined to become work-destroyed farm wives.
They were handsome girls and they carried with them the glow of their descent from the kings of
Ireland. They had a pride that transcended their poverty. No one ever thought of them as
deserving pity. Samuel raised a distinctly superior breed. They were better read and better bred
than most of their contemporaries. To all of them Samuel communicated his love of learning, and
he set them apart from the prideful ignorance of their time. Olive Hamilton became a teacher.
That meant that she left home at fifteen and went to live in Salinas, where she could go to
secondary school. At seventeen she took county board examinations, which covered all the arts
and sciences, and at eighteen she was teaching school at Peach Tree.
In her school there were pupils older and bigger than she was. It required great tact to be a
schoolteacher. To keep order among the big undisciplined boys without pistol and bull whip was
a difficult and dangerous business. In one school in the mountains a teacher was raped by her
pupils.
Olive Hamilton had not only to teach everything, but to all ages. Very few youths went past the
eighth grade in those days, and what with farm duties some of them took fourteen or fifteen years
to do it. Olive also had to practice rudimentary medicine, for there were constant accidents. She
sewed up knife cuts after a fight in the schoolyard. When a small barefooted boy was bitten by a

rattlesnake, it was her duty to suck his toe to draw the poison out.
She taught reading to the first grade and algebra to the eighth. She led the singing, acted as a
critic of literature, wrote the social notes that went weekly to the Salinas Journal. In addition, the
whole social life of the area was in her hands, not only graduation exercises, but dances,
meetings, debates, chorals, Christmas and May Day festivals, patriotic exudations on Decoration
Day and the Fourth of July. She was on the election board and headed and held together all
charities. It was far from an easy job, and it had duties and obligations beyond belief. The teacher
had no private life. She was watched jealously for any weakness of character. She could not
board with one family for more than one term, for that would cause jealousy—a family gained
social ascendancy by boarding the teacher. If a mar-riageable son belonged to the family where
she boarded a proposal was automatic; if there was more than one claimant, vicious fights
occurred over her hand. The Aguita boys, three of them, nearly clawed each other to death over
Olive Hamilton. Teachers rarely lasted very long in the country schools. The work was so hard
and the proposals so constant that they married within a very short time.
This was a course Olive Hamilton determined she would not take. She did not share the
intellectual en-thusiasms of her father, but the time she had spent in Salinas determined her not to
be a ranch wife. She wanted to live in a town, perhaps not so big as Salinas but at least not a
crossroads. In Salinas, Olive had experienced niceties of living, the choir and vestments, Altar
Guild, and bean suppers of the Episcopal church. She had partaken of the arts—road companies
of plays and even operas, with their magic and promise of an aromatic world outside. She had
gone to parties, played charades, competed in poetry readings, joined a chorus and orchestra.
Salinas had tempted her. There she could go to a party dressed for the party and come home in
the same dress, instead of rolling her clothes in a saddlebag and riding ten miles, then unrolling
and pressing them.
Busy though she was with her teaching, Olive longed for the metropolitan life, and when the
young man who had built the flour mill in King City sued properly for her hand, she accepted
him subject to a long and secret engagement. The secrecy was required because if it were known
there would be trouble among the young men in the neighborhood.
Olive had not her father’s brilliance, but she did have a sense of fun, together with her mother’s
strong and undeviating will. What light and beauty could be forced down the throats of her
reluctant pupils, she forced.
There was a wall against learning. A man wanted his children to read, to figure, and that was
enough. More might make them dissatisfied and flighty. And there were plenty of examples to
prove that learning made a boy leave the farm to live in the city—to consider himself better than
his father. Enough arithmetic to measure land and lumber and to keep accounts, enough writing
to order goods and write to relatives, enough reading for newspapers, almanacs, and farm
journals, enough music for religious and patriotic display—that was enough to help a boy and not
to lead him astray. Learning was for doctors, lawyers, and teachers, a class set off and not
considered related to other people. There were some sports, of course, like Samuel Hamilton, and
he was tolerated and liked, but if he had not been able to dig a well, shoe a horse, or run a

threshing machine, God knows what would have been thought of the family.
Olive did marry her young man and did move, first to Paso Robles, then to King City, and finally
to Salinas. She was as intuitive as a cat. Her acts were based on feelings rather than thoughts. She
had her mother’s firm chin and button nose and her father’s fine eyes. She was the most definite
of any of the Hamiltons except her mother. Her theology was a curious mixture of Irish fairies
and an Old Testament Jehovah whom in her later life she confused with her father. Heaven was to
her a nice home ranch inhabited by her dead rela-tives. External realities of a frustrating nature
she oblit-erated by refusing to-believe in them, and when one resisted her disbelief she raged at it.
It was told of her that she cried bitterly because she could not go to two dances on one Saturday
night. One was in Greenfield and the other in San Lucas—twenty miles apart. To have gone to
both and then home would have entailed a sixty-mile horseback ride. This was a fact she could
not blast with her disbelief, and so she cried with vexation and went to neither dance.
As she grew older she developed a scattergun method for dealing with unpleasant facts. When I,
her only son, was sixteen I contracted pleural pneumonia, in that day a killing disease. I went
down and down, until the wing tips of the angels brushed my eyes. Olive used her scattergun
method of treating pleural pneumonia, and it worked. The Episcopalian minister prayed with and
for me, the Mother Superior and nuns of the convent next to our house held me up to Heaven for
relief twice a day, a distant relative who was a Christian Science reader held the thought for me.
Every incantation, magic, and herbal formula known was brought out, and she got two good
nurses and the town’s best doctors. Her method was practical. I got well. She was loving and firm
with her family, three girls and me, trained us in housework, dish washing, clothes washing, and
man-ners. When angered she had a terrible eye which could blanch the skin off a bad child as
easily as if he were a boiled almond.
When I recovered from my pneumonia it came time for me to learn to walk again. I had been nine
weeks in bed, and the muscles had gone lax and the laziness of recovery had set in. When I was
helped up, every nerve cried, and the wound in my side, which had been opened to drain the pus
from the pleural cavity, pained horribly. I fell back in bed, crying, “I can’t do it! I can’t get up!”
Olive fixed me with her terrible eye. “Get up!” she said. “Your father has worked all day and sat
up all night. He has gone into debt for you. Now get up!”
And I got up.
Debt was an ugly word and an ugly concept to Olive. A bill unpaid past the fifteenth of the month
was a debt. The word had connotations of dirt and sloven-liness and dishonor. Olive, who truly
believed that her family was the best in the world, quite snobbishly would not permit it to be
touched by debt. She planted that terror of debt so deeply in her children that even now, in a
changed economic pattern where indebted-ness is a part of living, I become restless when a bill is
two days overdue. Olive never accepted the time-pay-ment plan when it became popular. A thing
bought on time was a thing you did not own and for which you were in debt. She saved for things
she wanted, and this meant that the neighbors had new gadgets as much as two years before we
did.

Olive had great courage. Perhaps it takes courage to raise children. And I must tell you what she
did about the First World War. Her thinking was not interna-tional. Her first boundary was the
geography of her family, second her town, Salinas, and finally there was a dotted line, not clearly
defined, which was the county line. Thus she did not quite believe in the war, not even when
Troop C, our militia cavalry, was called out, loaded its horses on a train, and set out for the open
world.
Martin Hopps lived around the corner from us. He was wide, short, red-haired. His mouth was
wide, and he had red eyes. He was almost the shyest boy in Salinas. To say good morning to him
was to make him itch with self-consciousness. He belonged to Troop C because the armory had a
basketball court.
If the Germans had known Olive and had been sensible they would have gone out of their way
not to anger her. But they didn’t know or they were stupid. When they killed Martin Hopps they
lost the war be-cause that made my mother mad and she took out after them. She had liked
Martin Hopps. He had never hurt anyone. When they killed him Olive declared war on the
German empire.
She cast about for a weapon. Knitting helmets and socks was not deadly enough for her. For a
time she put on a Red Cross uniform and met other ladies similarly dressed in the armory, where
bandages were rolled and reputations unrolled. This was all right, but it was not driving at the
heart of the Kaiser. Olive wanted blood for the life of Martin Hopps. She found her weapon in
Liberty bonds. She had never sold any-thing in her life beyond an occasional angel cake for the
Altar Guild in the basement of the Episcopal church, but she began to sell bonds by the bale. She
brought ferocity to her work. I think she made people afraid not to buy them. And when they did
buy from Olive she gave them a sense of actual combat, of put-ting a bayonet in the stomach of
Germany.
As her sales skyrocketed and stayed up, the Treasury Department began to notice this new
Amazon. First there came mimeographed letters of commendation, then real letters signed by the
Secretary of the Treasury, and not with a rubber stamp either. We were proud but not so proud as
when prizes began to arrive, a German helmet (too small for any of us to wear), a bayonet, a
jagged piece of shrapnel set on an ebony base. Since we were not eligible for armed conflict
beyond marching with wooden guns, our mother’s war seemed to justify us. And then she outdid
herself, and outdid everyone in our part of the country. She quadrupled her already fabulous
record and she was awarded the fairest prize of all—a ride in an army airplane.
Oh, we were proud kids! Even vicariously this was an eminence we could hardly stand. But my
poor mother—I must tell you that there are certain things in the existence of which my mother
did not believe, against any possible evidence to the contrary. One was a bad Hamilton and
another was the airplane. The fact that she had seen them didn’t make her believe in them one bit
more.
In the light of what she did I have tried to imagine how she felt. Her soul must have crawled with
horror, for how can you fly in something that does not exist? As a punishment the ride would
have been cruel and unusual, but it was a prize, a gift, an honor, and an eminence. She must have

looked into our eyes and seen the shining idolatry there and understood that she was trapped. Not
to have gone would have let her family down. She was surrounded, and there was no honorable
way out save death. Once she had decided to go up in the nonexistent thing she seemed to have
had no idea whatever that she would survive it.
Olive made her will—took lots of time with it and had it checked to be sure it was legal. Then she
opened her rosewood box wherein were the letters her husband had written to her in courtship
and since. We had not known he wrote poetry to her, but he had. She built a fire in the grate and
burned every letter. They were hers, and she wanted no other human to see them. She bought all
new underwear. She had a horror of being found dead with mended or, worse, unmended underclothes. I think perhaps she saw the wide twisted mouth and embarrassed eyes of Martin Hopps
on her and felt that in some way she was reimbursing him for his stolen life. She was very gentle
with us and did not notice a badly washed dinner plate that left a greasy stain on the dish towel.
This glory was scheduled to take place at the Salinas Race Track and Rodeo Grounds. We were
driven to the track in an army automobile, feeling more solemn and golden than at a good funeral.
Our father was working at the Spreckles Sugar Factory, five miles from town and could not get
off, or perhaps didn’t want to, for fear he could not stand the strain. But Olive had made
arrangements, on pain of not going up, for the plane to try to fly as far as the sugar factory before
it crashed.
I realize now that the several hundred people who had gathered simply came to see the airplane,
but at that time we thought they were there to do my mother honor. Olive was not a tall woman
and at that age she had begun to put on weight. We had to help her out of the car. She was
probably stiff with fright but her little chin was set.
The plane stood in the field around which the race track was laid out. It was appallingly little and
flimsy—an open cockpit biplane with wooden struts, tied with piano wire. The wings were
covered with canvas. Olive was stunned. She went to the side as an ox to the knife. Over the
clothes she was convinced were her burial clothes, two sergeants slipped on a coat, a padded coat,
and a flight coat, and she grew rounder and rounder with each layer. Then a leather helmet and
goggles, and with her little button of a nose and her pink cheeks you really had something. She
looked like a goggled ball. The two sergeants hoisted her bodily into the cockpit and wedged her
in. She filled the opening completely. As they strapped her in she suddenly came to life and
began waving frantically for attention. One of the sol-diers climbed up, listened to her, came over
to my sister Mary, and led her to the side of the plane. Olive was tugging at the thick padded
flight glove on her left hand. She got her hands free, took off her engagement ring with its tiny
diamond, and handed it down to Mary. She set her gold wedding ring firmly, pulled the gloves
back on, and faced the front. The pilot climbed into the front cockpit, and one of the sergeants
threw his weight on the wooden propeller. The little ship taxied away and turned, and down the
field it roared and staggered into the air, and Olive was looking straight ahead and probably her
eyes were closed.
We followed it with our eyes as it swept up and away, leaving a lonesome silence behind it. The
bond committee, the friends and relatives, the simple unhonored spectators didn’t think of leaving

the field. The plane became a speck in the sky toward Spreckles and disappeared. It was fifteen
minutes before we saw it again, flying serenely and very high. Then to our horror it seemed to
stagger and fall. It fell endlessly, caught itself, climbed, and made a loop. One of the sergeants
laughed. For a moment the plane steadied and then it seemed to go crazy. It barrel-rolled, made
Immelmann turns, inside and outside loops, and turned over and flew over the field upside down.
We could see the black bullet which was our mother’s helmet. One of the soldiers said quietly, “I
think he’s gone nuts. She’s not a young woman.”
The airplane landed steadily enough and ran up to the group. The motor died. The pilot climbed
out, shaking his head in perplexity. “Goddamest woman I ever saw,” he said. He reached up and
shook Olive’s nerveless hand and walked hurriedly away.
It took four men and quite a long time to get Olive out of the cockpit. She was so rigid they could
not bend her. We took her home and put her to bed, and she didn’t get up for two days.
What had happened came out slowly. The pilot talked some and Olive talked some, and both
stories had to be put together before they made sense. They had flown out and circled the
Spreckles Sugar Factory as ordered—circled it three times so that our father would be sure to see,
and then the pilot thought of a joke. He meant no harm. He shouted something, and his face
looked contorted. Olive could not hear over the noise of the engine. The pilot throttled down and
shouted, “Stunt?” It was a kind of joke. Olive saw his goggled face and the slip stream caught his
word and distorted it. What Olive heard was the word “stuck.”
Well, she thought, here it is just as I knew it would be. Here was her death. Her mind flashed to
see if she had forgotten anything—will made, letters burned, new underwear, plenty of food in
the house for dinner. She wondered whether she had turned out the light in the back room. It was
all in a second. Then she thought there might be an outside chance of survival. The young soldier
was obviously frightened and fear might be the worst thing that could happen to him in handling
the situation. If she gave way to the panic that lay on her heart it might frighten him more. She
decided to encourage him. She smiled brightly and nodded to give him courage, and then the
bottom fell out of the world. When he leveled out of his loop the pilot looked back again and
shouted, “More?”
Olive was way beyond hearing anything, but her chin was set and she was determined to help the
pilot so that he would not be too afraid before they hit the earth. She smiled and nodded again. At
the end of each stunt he looked back, and each time she encouraged him. Afterward he said over
and over, “She’s the goddamest woman I ever saw. I tore up the rule book and she wanted more.
Good Christ, what a pilot she would have made!”

Chapter 15
1
Adam sat like a contented cat on his land. From the entrance to the little draw under a giant oak,
which dipped its roots into underground water, he could look out over the acres lying away to the
river and across to an alluvial flat and then up the rounded foothills on the western side. It was a
fair place even in the summer when the sun laced into it. A line of river willows and sycamores
banded it in the middle, and the western hills were yellow-brown with feed. For some reason the
mountains to the west of the Salinas Valley have a thicker skin of earth on them than have the
eastern foothills, so that the grass is richer there. Perhaps the peaks store rain and distribute it
more evenly, and perhaps, being more wooded, they draw more rainfall.
Very little of the Sanchez, now Trask, place was under cultivation, but Adam in his mind could
see the wheat growing tall and squares of green alfalfa near the river. Behind him he could hear
the rackety hammering of the carpenters brought all the way from Salinas to rebuild the old
Sanchez house. Adams had decided to live in the old house. Here was a place in which to plant
his dynasty. The manure was scraped out, the old floors torn up, neck-rubbed window casings
ripped away. New sweet wood was going in, pine sharp with resin and velvety redwood and a
new roof of long split shakes. The old thick walls sucked in coat after coat of white-wash made
with lime and salt water, which, as it dried, seemed to have a luminosity of its own.
He planned a permanent seat. A gardener had trimmed the ancient roses, planted geraniums, laid
out the vegetable flat, and brought the living spring in little channels to wander back and forth
through the garden. Adam foretasted comfort for himself and his descen-dants. In a shed, covered
with tarpaulins, lay the crated heavy furniture sent from San Francisco and carted out from King
City.
He would have good living too. Lee, his pigtailed Chinese cook, had made a special trip to Pajaro
to buy the pots and kettles and pans, kegs, jars, copper, and glass for his kitchen. A new pigsty
was building far from the house and downwind, with chicken and duck runs near and a kennel for
the dogs to keep the coyotes away. It was no quick thing Adam contemplated, to be finished and
ready in a hurry. His men worked deliber-ately and slowly. It was a long job. Adam wanted it
well done. He inspected every wooden joint, stood off to study paint samples on a shingle. In the
corner of his room catalogues piled up—catalogues for machinery, furnishing, seeds, fruit trees.
He was glad now that his father had left him a rich man. In his mind a darkness was settling over
his memory of Connecticut. Perhaps the hard flat light of the West was blotting out his
birthplace. When he thought back to his father’s house, to the farm, the town, to his brother’s
face, there was a blackness over all of it. And he shook off the memories.
Temporarily he had moved Cathy into the white-painted, clean spare house of Bordoni, there to

await the home and the child. There was no doubt whatever that the child would be finished well
before the house was ready. But Adam was unhurried.
“I want it built strong,” he directed over and over. “I want it to last—copper nails and hard wood
—nothing to rust and rot.”
He was not alone in his preoccupation with the future. The whole valley, the whole West was that
way. It was a time when the past had lost its sweetness and its sap. You’d go a good long road
before you’d find a man, and he very old, who wished to bring back a golden past. Men were
notched and comfortable in the present, hard and unfruitful as it was, but only as a doorstep into a
fantastic future. Rarely did two men meet, or three stand in a bar, or a dozen gnaw tough venison
in camp, that the valley’s future, paralyzing in its grandeur, did not come up, not as conjecture
but as a certainty.
“It’ll be—who knows? maybe in our lifetime,” they said.
And people found happiness in the future according to their present lack. Thus a man might bring
his family down from a hill ranch in a drag—a big box nailed on oaken runners which pulled
bumping down the broken hills. In the straw of the box, his wife would brace the children against
the tooth-shattering, tongue-biting crash of the runners against stone and ground. And the father
would set his heels and think, When the roads come in—then will be the time. Why, we’ll sit
high and happy in a surrey and get clear into King City in three hours—and what more in the
world could you want than that?
Or let a man survey his grove of live-oak trees, hard as coal and hotter, the best firewood in the
world. In his pocket might be a newspaper with a squib: “Oak cord wood is bringing ten dollars a
cord in Los Angeles.” Why, hell, when the railroad puts a branch out here, I could lay it down
neat, broke up and seasoned, right beside the track, for a dollar and a half a cord. Let’s go whole
hog and say the Southern Pacific will charge three-fifty to carry it. There’s still five dollars a
cord, and there’s three thousand cords in that little grove alone. That’s fifteen thousand dollars
right there.
There were others who prophesied, with rays shin-ing on their foreheads, about the sometime
ditches that would carry water all over the valley—who knows? maybe in our lifetime—or deep
wells with steam engines to pump the water up out of the guts of the world. Can you imagine?
Just think what this land would raise with plenty of water! Why, it will be a frigging garden!
Another man, but he was crazy, said that someday there’d be a way, maybe ice, maybe some
other way, to get a peach like this here I got in my hand clear to Philadelphia.
In the towns they talked of sewers and inside toilets, and some already had them; and arc lights
on the street corners—Salinas had those—and telephones. There wasn’t any limit, no boundary at
all, to the future. And it would be so a man wouldn’t have room to store his happiness.
Contentment would flood raging down the valley like the Salinas River in March of a thirty-inch
year.
They looked over the flat dry dusty valley and the ugly mushroom towns and they saw a
loveliness—who knows? maybe in our lifetime. That’s one reason you couldn’t laugh too much
at Samuel Hamilton. He let his mind range more deliciously than any other, and it didn’t sound so

silly when you heard what they were doing in San Jose. Where Samuel went haywire was
wondering whether people would be happy when all that came.
Happy? He’s haywire now. Just let us get it, and we’ll show you happiness.
And Samuel could remember hearing of a cousin of his mother’s in Ireland, a knight and rich and
hand-some, and anyway shot himself on a silken couch, sitting beside the most beautiful woman
in the world who loved him.
“There’s a capacity for appetite,” Samuel said, “that a whole heaven and earth of cake can’t
satisfy.”
Adam Trask nosed some of his happiness into fu-tures but there was present contentment in him
too. He felt his heart smack up against his throat when he saw Cathy sitting in the sun, quiet, her
baby growing, and a transparency to her skin that made him think of the angels on Sunday School
cards. Then a breeze would move her bright hair, or she would raise her eyes, and Adam would
swell out in his stomach with a pressure of ecstasy that was close kin to grief.
If Adam rested like a sleek fed cat on his land, Cathy was catlike too. She had the inhuman
attribute of abandoning what she could not get and of waiting for what she could get. These two
gifts gave her great advantages. Her pregnancy had been an accident. When her attempt to abort
herself failed and the doctor threatened her, she gave up that method. This does not mean that she
reconciled herself to pregnancy. She sat it out as she would have weathered an illness. Her
marriage to Adam had been the same. She was trapped and she took the best possible way out.
She had not wanted to go to California either, but other plans were denied her for the time being.
As a very young child she had learned to win by using the momentum of her opponent. It was
easy to guide a man’s strength where it was impossible to resist him. Very few people in the
world could have known that Cathy did not want to be where she was and in the condition she
was. She relaxed and waited for the change she knew must come some time. Cathy had the one
quality required of a great and successful criminal: she trusted no one, con-fided in no one. Her
self was an island. It is probable that she did not even look at Adam’s new land or build-ing
house, or turn his towering plans to reality in her mind, because she did not intend to live here
after her sickness was over, after her trap opened. But to his questions she gave proper answers;
to do otherwise would be waste motion, and dissipated energy, and for-eign to a good cat.
“See, my darling, how the house lies—windows look-ing down the valley?”
“It’s beautiful.”
“You know, it may sound foolish, but I find myself trying to think the way old Sanchez did a
hundred years ago. How was the valley then? He must have planned so carefully. You know, he
had pipes? He did—made out of redwood with a hole bored or burned through to carry the water
down from the spring. We dug up some pieces of it.”
“That’s remarkable,” she said. “He must have been clever.”
“I’d like to know more about him. From the way the house sets, the trees he left, the shape and
proportion of the house, he must have been a kind of an artist.”
“He was a Spaniard, wasn’t he? They’re artistic peo-ple, I’ve heard. I remember in school about a
painter—no, he was a Greek.”

“I wonder where I could find out about old San-chez.”
“Well, somebody must know.”
“All of his work and planning, and Bordoni kept cows in the house. You know what I wonder
about most?”
“What, Adam?”
“I wonder if he had a Cathy and who she was.”
She smiled and looked down and away from him. “The things you say.”
“He must have had! He must have had. I never had energy or direction or—well, even a very
great desire to live before I had you.”
“Adam, you embarrass me. Adam, be careful. Don’t joggle me, it hurts.”
“I’m sorry. I’m so clumsy.”
“No, you’re not. You just don’t think. Should I be knitting or sewing, do you suppose? I’m so
comfortable just sitting.”
“We’ll buy everything we need. You just sit and be comfortable. I guess in a way you’re working
harder than anyone here. But the pay—the pay is wonderful.”
“Adam, the scar on my forehead isn’t going to go away, I’m afraid.”
“The doctor said it would fade in time.”
“Well, sometimes it seems to be getting fainter, and then it comes back. Don’t you think it’s
darker today?”
“No, I don’t.”
But it was. It looked like a huge thumbprint, even to whorls of wrinkled skin. He put his finger
near, and she drew her head away.
“Don’t,” she said. “It’s tender to the touch. It turns red if you touch it.”
“It will go away. Just takes a little time, that’s all.”
She smiled as he turned, but when he walked away her eyes were flat and directionless. She
shifted her body restlessly. The baby was kicking. She relaxed and all her muscles loosened. She
waited.
Lee came near where her chair was set under the biggest oak tree. “Missy likee tea?”
“No—yes, I would too.”
Her eyes inspected him and her inspection could not penetrate the dark brown of his eyes. He
made her uneasy. Cathy had always been able to shovel into the mind of any man and dig up his
impulses and his desires. But Lee’s brain gave and repelled like rubber. His face was lean and
pleasant, his forehead broad, firm, and sensitive, and his lips curled in a perpetual smile. His long
black glossy braided queue, tied at the bottom with a narrow piece of black silk, hung over his
shoulder and moved rhythmically against his chest. When he did violent work he curled his
queue on top of his head. He wore narrow cotton trousers, black heelless slippers, and a frogged
Chinese smock. When-ever he could he hid his hands in his sleeves as though he were afraid for
them, as most Chinese did in that day.
“I bling litta table,” he said, bowed slightly, and shuffled away.
Cathy looked after him, and her eyebrows drew down in a scowl. She was not afraid of Lee, yet

she was not comfortable with him either. But he was a good and respectful servant—the best.
And what harm could he do her?

2
The summer progressed and the Salinas River retired underground or stood in green pools under
high banks. The cattle lay drowsing all day long under the willows and only moved out at night to
feed. An umber tone came to the grass. And the afternoon winds blowing inevitably down the
valley started a dust that was like fog and raised it into the sky almost as high as the
mountaintops. The wild oat roots stood up like nigger-heads where the winds blew the earth
away. Along a polished earth, pieces of straw and twigs scampered until they were stopped by
some rooted thing; and little stones rolled crookedly before the wind.
It became more apparent than ever why old Sanchez had built his house in the little draw, for the
wind and the dust did not penetrate, and the spring, while it diminished, still gushed a head of
cold clear water. But Adam, looking out over his dry dust-obscured land, felt the panic the
Eastern man always does at first in Cali-fornia. In a Connecticut summer two weeks without rain
is a dry spell and four a drought. If the countryside is not green it is dying. But in California it
does not ordinarily rain at all between the end of May and the first of November. The Eastern
man, though he has been told, feels the earth is sick in the rainless months.
Adam sent Lee with a note to the Hamilton place to ask Samuel to visit him and discuss the
boring of some wells on his new place.
Samuel was sitting in the shade, watching his son Tom design and build a revolutionary coon
trap, when Lee drove up in the Trask cart. Lee folded his hands in his sleeves and waited. Samuel
read the note. “Tom,” he said, “do you think you could keep the estate going while I run down
and talk water with a dry man?”
“Why don’t I go with you? You might need some help.”
“At talking?—that I don’t. It won’t come to digging for some time if I’m any judge. With wells
there’s got to be a great deal of talk—five or six hundred words for every shovel of dirt.”
“I’d like to go—it’s Mr. Trask, isn’t it? I didn’t meet him when he came here.”
“You’ll do that when the digging starts. I’m older than you. I’ve got first claim on the talk. You
know, Tom, a coon is going to reach his pretty little hand through here and let himself out. You
know how clever they are.”
“See this piece here? It screws on and turns down here. You couldn’t get out of that yourself.”
“I’m not so clever as a coon. I think you’ve worked it out, though. Tom, boy, would you saddle
Doxology while I go tell your mother where I’m going?”
“I bling lig,” said Lee.
“Well, I have to come home some time.”
“I bling back.”
“Nonsense,” said Samuel. “I’ll lead my horse in and ride back.”
Samuel sat in the buggy beside Lee, and his clobber-footed saddle horse shuffled clumsily behind.
“What’s your name?” Samuel asked pleasantly.

“Lee. Got more name. Lee papa family name. Call Lee.”
“I’ve read quite a lot about China. You born in China?”
“No. Born here.”
Samuel was silent for quite a long time while the buggy lurched down the wheel track toward the
dusty valley. “Lee,” he said at last, “I mean no disrespect, but I’ve never been able to figure why
you people still talk pidgin when an illiterate baboon from the black bogs of Ireland, with a head
full of Gaelic and a tongue like a potato, learns to talk a poor grade of English in ten years.”
Lee grinned. “Me talkee Chinese talk,” he said.
“Well, I guess you have your reasons. And it’s not my affair. I hope you’ll forgive me if I don’t
believe it, Lee.”
Lee looked at him and the brown eyes under their rounded upper lids seemed to open and deepen
until they weren’t foreign any more, but man’s eyes, warm with understanding. Lee chuckled.
“It’s more than a convenience,” he said. “It’s even more than self-pro-tection. Mostly we have to
use it to be understood at all.”
Samuel showed no sign of having observed any change. “I can understand the first two,” he said
thoughtfully, “but the third escapes me.”
Lee said, “I know it’s hard to believe, but it has happened so often to me and to my friends that
we take if for granted. If I should go up to a lady or a gentle-man, for instance, and speak as I am
doing now, I wouldn’t be understood.”
“Why not?”
“Pidgin they expect, and pidgin they’ll listen to. But English from me they don’t listen to, and so
they don’t understand it.”
“Can that be possible? How do I understand you?”
“That’s why I’m talking to you. You are one of the rare people who can separate your
observation from your preconception. You see what is, where most peo-ple see what they expect.”
“I hadn’t thought of it. And I’ve not been so tested as you, but what you say has a candle of truth.
You know, I’m very glad to talk to you. I’ve wanted to ask so many questions.”
“Happy to oblige.”
“So many questions. For instance, you wear the queue. I’ve read that it is a badge of slavery
imposed by conquest by the Manchus on the Southern Chinese.”
“That is true.”
“Then why in the name of God do you wear it here, where the Manchus can’t get at you?”
“Talkee Chinese talk. Queue Chinese fashion—you savvy?”
Samuel laughed loudly. “That does have the green touch of convenience,” he said. “I wish I had a
hidey-hole like that.”
“I’m wondering whether I can explain,” said Lee. “Where there is no likeness of experience it’s
very difficult. I understand you were not born in America.”
“No, in Ireland.”
“And in a few years you can almost disappear; while I, who was born in Grass Valley, went to
school and several years to the University of California, have no chance of mixing.”

“If you cut your queue, dressed and talked like other people?”
“No. I tried it. To the so-called whites I was still a Chinese, but an untrustworthy one; and at the
same time my Chinese friends steered clear of me. I had to give it up.”
Lee pulled up under a tree, got out and unfastened the check rein. “Time for lunch,” he said. “I
made a package. Would you like some?”
“Sure I would. Let me get down in the shade there. I forget to eat sometimes, and that’s strange
because I’m always hungry. I’m interested in what you say. It has a sweet sound of authority.
Now it peeks into my mind that you should go back to China.”
Lee smiled satirically at him. “In a few minutes I don’t think you’ll find a loose bar I’ve missed
in a lifetime of search. I did go back to China. My father was a fairly successful man. It didn’t
work. They said I looked like a foreign devil; they said I spoke like a foreign devil. I made
mistakes in manners, and I didn’t know delicacies that had grown up since my father left. They
wouldn’t have me. You can believe it or not—I’m less foreign here than I was in China.”
“I’ll have to believe you because it’s reasonable. You’ve given me things to think about until at
least February twenty-seventh. Do you mind my questions?”
“As a matter of fact, no. The trouble with pidgin is that you get to thinking in pidgin. I write a
great deal to keep my English up. Hearing and reading aren’t the same as speaking and writing.”
“Don’t you ever make a mistake? I mean, break into English?”
“No, I don’t. I think it’s a matter of what is expect-ed. You look at a man’s eyes, you see that he
expects pidgin and a shuffle, so you speak pidgin and shuffle.”
“I guess that’s right,” said Samuel. “In my own way I tell jokes because people come all the way
to my place to laugh. I try to be funny for them even when the sadness is on me.”
“But the Irish are said to be a happy people, full of jokes.”
“There’s your pidgin and your queue. They’re not. They’re a dark people with a gift for suffering
way past their deserving. It’s said that without whisky to soak and soften the world, they’d kill
themselves. But they tell jokes because it’s expected of them.”
Lee unwrapped a little bottle. “Would you like some of this? Chinese drink ng-ka-py.”
“What is it?”
“Chinee blandy. Stlong dlink—as a matter of fact it’s a brandy with a dosage of wormwood. Very
powerful. It softens the world.”
Samuel sipped from the bottle. “Tastes a little like rotten apples,” he said.
“Yes, but nice rotten apples. Taste it back along your tongue toward the roots.”
Samuel took a big swallow and tilted his head back. “I see what you mean. That is good.”
“Here are some sandwiches, pickles, cheese, a can of buttermilk.”
“You do well.”
“Yes, I see to it.”
Samuel bit into a sandwich. “I was shuffling over half a hundred questions. What you said brings
the brightest one up. You don’t mind?”
“Not at all. The only thing I do want to ask of you is not to talk this way when other people are
listening. It would only confuse them and they wouldn’t believe it anyway.”

“I’ll try,” said Samuel. “If I slip, just remember that I’m a comical genius. It’s hard to split a man
down the middle and always to reach for the same half.”
“I think I can guess what your next question is.”
“What?”
“Why am I content to be a servant?”
“How in the world did you know?”
“It seemed to follow.”
“Do you resent the question?”
“Not from you. There are no ugly questions except those clothed in condescension. I don’t know
where being a servant came into disrepute. It is the refuge of a philosopher, the food of the lazy,
and, properly carried out, it is a position of power, even of love. I can’t understand why more
intelligent people don’t take it as a career—learn to do it well and reap its benefits. A good
servant has absolute security, not because of his master’s kindness, but because of habit and
indolence. It’s a hard thing for a man to change spices or lay out his own socks. He’ll keep a bad
servant rather than change. But a good servant, and I am an excellent one, can completely control
his master, tell him what to think, how to act, whom to marry, when to divorce, reduce him to
terror as a discipline, or distribute hap-piness to him, and finally be mentioned in his will. If I had
wished I could have robbed, stripped, and beaten anyone I’ve worked for and come away with
thanks. Finally, in my circumstances I am unprotected. My master will defend me, protect me.
You have to work and worry. I work less and worry less. And I am a good servant. A bad one
does no work and does no worrying, and he still is fed, clothed, and protected. I don’t know any
profession where the field is so clut-tered with incompetents and where excellence is so rare.”
Samuel leaned toward him, listening intently.
Lee went on, “It’s going to be a relief after that to go back to pidgin.”
“It’s a very short distance to the Sanchez place. Why did we stop so near?” Samuel asked.
“Allee time talkee. Me Chinee number one boy. You leddy go now?”
“What? Oh, sure. But it must be a lonely life.”
“That’s the only fault with it,” said Lee. “I’ve been thinking of going to San Francisco and
starting a little business.”
“Like a laundry? Or a grocery store?”
“No. Too many Chinese laundries and restaurants. I thought perhaps a bookstore. I’d like that,
and the competition wouldn’t be too great. I probably won’t do it though. A servant loses his
initiative.”

In the afternoon Samuel and Adam rode over the land. The wind came up as it did every
afternoon, and the yellow dust ran into the sky.
“Oh, it’s a good piece,” Samuel cried. “It’s a rare piece of land.”
“Seems to me it’s blowing away bit by bit,” Adam observed.
“No, it’s just moving over a little. You lose some to the James ranch but you get some from the

Southeys.”
“Well, I don’t like the wind. Makes me nervous.”
“Nobody likes wind for very long. It makes animals nervous and restless too. I don’t know
whether you noticed, but a little farther up the valley they’re plant-ing windbreaks of gum trees.
Eucalyptus—comes from Australia. They say the gums grow ten feet a year. Why don’t you try a
few rows and see what happens? In time they should back up the wind a little, and they make
grand firewood.”
“Good idea,” Adam said. “What I really want is water. This wind would pump all the water I
could find. I thought if I could bring in a few wells and irrigate, the topsoil wouldn’t blow away. I
might try some beans.”
Samuel squinted into the wind. “I’ll try to get you water if you want,” he said. “And I’ve got a
little pump I made that will bring it up fast. It’s my own invention. A windmill is a pretty costly
thing. Maybe I could build them for you and save you some money.”
“That’s good,” said Adam. “I wouldn’t mind the wind if it worked for me. And if I could get
water I might plant alfalfa.”
“It’s never brought much of a price.”
“I wasn’t thinking of that. Few weeks ago I took a drive up around Greenfield and Gonzales.
Some Swiss have moved in there. They’ve got nice little dairy herds, and they get four crops of
alfalfa a year.”
“I heard about them. They brought in Swiss cows.” Adam’s face was bright with plans. “That’s
what I want to do. Sell butter and cheese and feed the milk to pigs.”
“You’re going to bring credit to the valley,” Samuels said. “You’re going to be a real joy to the
future.”
“If I can get water.”
“I’ll get you water if there’s any to be got. I’ll find it. I brought my magic wand.” He patted a
forked stick tied to his saddle.
Adam pointed to the left where a wide flat place was covered with a low growth of sagebrush.
“Now then,” he said, “thirty-six acres and almost level as a floor. I put an auger down. Topsoil
averages three and a half feet, sand on top and loam within plow reach. Think you could get
water there?”
“I don’t know,” Samuel said. “I’ll see.” He dismounted, handed his reins to Adam, and un-tied
his forked wand. He took the forks in his two hands and walked slowly, his arms out and
stretched before him and the wand tip up. His steps took a zigzag course. Once he frowned and
backed up a few steps, then shook his head and went on. Adam rode slowly behind, leading the
other horse.
Adam kept his eyes on the stick. He saw it quiver and then jerk a little, as though an invisible fish
were tugging at a line. Samuel’s face was taut with attention. He continued on until the point of
the wand seemed to be pulled strongly downward against his straining arms. He made a slow
circle, broke off a piece of sagebrush, and dropped it on the ground. He moved well outside his
circle, held up his stick again, and moved inward toward his marker. As he came near it, the point

of the stick was drawn down again. Samuel sighed and relaxed and dropped his wand on the
ground. “I can get water here,” he said. “And not very deep. The pull was strong, plenty of water.”
“Good,” said Adam. “I want to show you a couple more places.”
Samuel whittled out a stout piece of sagewood and drove it into the soil. He made a split on the
top and fitted a crosspiece on for a mark. Then he kicked the brittle brush down in the area so he
could find his marker again.
On a second try three hundred yards away the wand seemed nearly torn downward out of his
hands. “Now there’s a whole world of water here,” he said.
The third try was not so productive. After half an hour he had only the slightest sign.
The two men rode slowly back toward the Trask house. The afternoon was golden, for the yellow
dust in the sky gilded the light. As always the wind began to drop as the day waned, but it
sometimes took half the night for the dust to settle out of the air. “I knew it was a good place,”
Samuel said. “Anyone can see that. But I didn’t know it was that good. You must have a great
drain under your land from the mountains. You know how to pick land, Mr. Trask.”
Adam smiled. “We had a farm in Connecticut,” he said. “For six generations we dug stones out.
One of the first things I remember is sledding stones over to the walls. I thought that was the way
all farms were. It’s strange to me and almost sinful here. If you wanted a stone, you’d have to go
a long way for it.”
“The ways of sin are curious,” Samuel observed. “I guess if a man had to shuck off everything he
had, inside and out, he’d manage to hide a few little sins somewhere for his own discomfort.
They’re the last things we’ll give up.”
“Maybe that’s a good thing to keep us humble. The fear of God in us.”
“I guess so,” said Samuel. “And I guess humility must be a good thing, since it’s a rare man who
has not a piece of it, but when you look at humbleness it’s hard to see where its value rests unless
you grant that it is a pleasurable pain and very precious. Suffering—I won-der has it been
properly looked at.”
“Tell me about your stick,” Adam said. “How does it work?”
Samuel stroked the fork now tied to his saddle strings. “I don’t really believe in it save that it
works.” He smiled at Adam. “Maybe it’s this way. Maybe I know where the water is, feel it in
my skin. Some people have a gift in this direction or that. Suppose—well, call it humility, or a
deep disbelief in myself, forced me to do a magic to bring up to the surface the thing I know
anyway. Does that make any sense to you?”
“I’d have to think about it,” said Adam.
The horses picked their own way, heads hung low, reins loosened against the bits.
“Can you stay the night?” Adam asked.
“I can but better not. I didn’t tell Liza I’d be away the night. I’d not like to give her a worry.”
“But she knows where you are.”
“Sure she knows. But I’ll ride home tonight. It doesn’t matter the time. If you’d like to ask me to
supper I’d be glad. And when do you want me to start on the wells?”
“Now—as soon as you can.”

“You know it’s no cheap thing, indulging yourself with water. I’d have to charge you fifty cents
or more a foot, depending on what we find down there. It can run into money.”
“I have the money. I want the wells. Look, Mr. Hamilton—”
“ ‘Samuel’ would be easier.”
“Look, Samuel, I mean to make a garden of my land. Remember my name is Adam. So far I’ve
had no Eden, let alone been driven out.”
“It’s the best reason I ever heard for making a garden,” Samuel exclaimed. He chuckled. “Where
will the orchard be?”
Adam said, “I won’t plant apples. That would be looking for accidents.”
“What does Eve say to that? She has a say, you remember. And Eves delight in apples.”
“Not this one.” Adam’s eyes were shining. “You don’t know this Eve. She’ll celebrate my
choice. I don’t think anyone can know her goodness.”
“You have a rarity. Right now I can’t recall any greater gift.”
They were coming near to the entrance to the little side valley in which was the Sanchez house.
They could see the rounded green tops of the great live oaks.
“Gift,” Adam said softly. “You can’t know. No one can know. I had a gray life, Mr. Hamilton—
Samuel. Not that it was bad compared to other lives, but it was nothing. I don’t know why I tell
you this.”
“Maybe because I like to hear.”
“My mother—died—before my memory. My stepmother was a good woman but troubled and ill.
My father was a stern, fine man—maybe a great man.”
“You couldn’t love him?”
“I had the kind of feeling you have in church, and not a little fear in it.”
Samuel nodded. “I know—and some men want that.” He smiled ruefully. “I’ve always wanted
the oth-er. Liza says it’s the weak thing in me.”
“My father put me in the army, in the West, against the Indians.”
“You told me. But you don’t think like a military man.”
“I wasn’t a good one. I seem to be telling you everything.”
“You must want to. There’s always a reason.”
“A soldier must want to do the things we had to do—or at least be satisfied with them. I couldn’t
find good enough reasons for killing men and women, nor understand the reasons when they were
explained.”
They rode on in silence for a time. Adam went on, “I came out of the army like dragging myself
muddy out of a swamp. I wandered for a long time before going home to a remembered place I
did not love.”
“Your father?”
“He died, and home was a place to sit around or work around, waiting for death the way you
might wait for a dreadful picnic.”
“Alone?”
“No, I have a brother.”

“Where is he—waiting for the picnic?”
“Yes—yes, that’s exactly what. Then Cathy came. Maybe I will tell you some time when I can
tell and you want to hear.”
“I’ll want to hear,” Samuel said. “I eat stories like grapes.”
“A kind of light spread out from her. And every-thing changed color. And the world opened out.
And a day was good to awaken to. And there were no limits to anything. And the people of the
world were good and handsome. And I was not afraid any more.”
“I recognize it,” Samuel said. “That’s an old friend of mine. It never dies but sometimes it moves
away, or you do. Yes, that’s my acquaintance—eyes, nose, mouth, and hair.”
“All this coming out of a little hurt girl.”
“And not out of you?”
“Oh, no, or it would have come before. No, Cathy brought it, and it lives around her. And now
I’ve told you why I want the wells. I have to repay somehow for value received. I’m going to
make a garden so good, so beautiful, that it will be a proper place for her to live and a fitting
place for her light to shine on.”
Samuel swallowed several times, and he spoke with a dry voice out of a pinched-up throat. “I can
see my duty,” he said. “I can see it plainly before me if I am any kind of man, any kind of friend
to you.”
“What do you mean?”
Samuel said satirically, “It’s my duty to take this thing of yours and kick it in the face, then raise
it up and spread slime on it thick enough to blot out its dangerous light.” His voice grew strong
with vehe-mence. “I should hold it up to you muck-covered and show you its dirt and danger. I
should warn you to look closer until you can see how ugly it really is. I should ask you to think of
inconstancy and give you examples. I should give you Othello’s handkerchief. Oh, I know I
should. And I should straighten out your tangled thoughts, show you that the impulse is gray as
lead and rotten as a dead cow in wet weather. If I did my duty well, I could give you back your
bad old life and feel good about it, and welcome you back to the musty membership in the lodge.”
“Are you joking? Maybe I shouldn’t have told—”
“It is the duty of a friend. I had a friend who did the duty once for me. But I’m a false friend. I’ll
get no credit for it among my peers. It’s a lovely thing, preserve it, and glory in it. And I’ll dig
your wells if I have to drive my rig to the black center of the earth. I’ll squeeze water out like
juice from an orange.”
They rode under the great oaks and toward the house. Adam said, “There she is, sitting outside.”
He shouted, “Cathy, he says there’s water—lots of it.” Aside he said excitedly, “Did you know
she’s going to have a baby?”
“Even at this distance she looks beautiful,” Samuel said.

Because the day had been hot, Lee set a table outside under an oak tree, and as the sun neared the
western mountains he padded back and forth from the kitchen, carrying the cold meats, pickles,

potato salad, coconut cake, and peach pie which were supper. In the center of the table he placed
a gigantic stoneware pitcher full of milk.
Adam and Samuel came from the wash house, their hair and faces shining with water, and
Samuel’s beard was fluffy after its soaping. They stood at the trestle table and waited until Cathy
came out.
She walked slowly, picking her way as though she were afraid she would fall. Her full skirt and
apron concealed to a certain extent her swelling abdomen. Her face was untroubled and childlike,
and she clasped her hands in front of her. She had reached the table before she looked up and
glanced from Samuel to Adam.
Adam held her chair for her. “You haven’t met Mr. Hamilton, dear,” he said.
She held out her hand. “How do you do,” she said.
Samuel had been inspecting her. “It’s a beautiful face,” he said, “I’m glad to meet you. You are
well, I hope?”
“Oh, yes. Yes, I’m well.”
The men sat down. “She makes it formal whether she wants to or not. Every meal is a kind of
occasion,” Adam said.
“Don’t talk like that,” she said. “It isn’t true.”
“Doesn’t it feel like a party to you, Samuel?” he asked.
“It does so, and I can tell you there’s never been such a candidate for a party as I am. And my
children—they’re worse. My boy Tom wanted to come today. He’s spoiling to get off the ranch.”
Samuel suddenly realized that he was making his speech last to prevent silence from falling on
the table. He paused, and the silence dropped. Cathy looked down at her plate while she ate a
sliver of roast lamb. She looked up as she put it between her small sharp teeth. Her wide-set eyes
communicated nothing. Sam-uel shivered.
“It isn’t cold, is it?” Adam asked.
“Cold? No. A goose walked over my grave, I guess.”
“Oh, yes, I know that feeling.”
The silence fell again. Samuel waited for some speech to start up, knowing in advance that it
would not.
“Do you like our valley, Mrs. Trask?”
“What? Oh, yes.”
“If it isn’t impertinent to ask, when is your baby due?”
“In about six weeks,” Adam said. “My wife is one of those paragons—a woman who does not
talk very much.”
“Sometimes a silence tells the most,” said Samuel, and he saw Cathy’s eyes leap up and down
again, and it seemed to him that the scar on her forehead grew darker. Something had flicked her
the way you’d flick a horse with the braided string popper on a buggy whip. Samuel couldn’t
recall what he had said that had made her give a small inward start. He felt a tenseness com-ing
over him that was somewhat like the feeling he had just before the water wand pulled down, an
awareness of something strange and strained. He glanced at Adam and saw that he was looking

raptly at his wife. Whatev-er was strange was not strange to Adam. His face had happiness on it.
Cathy was chewing a piece of meat, chewing with her front teeth. Samuel had never seen anyone
chew that way before. And when she had swallowed, her little tongue flicked around her lips.
Samuel’s mind repeated, “Something—something—can’t find what it is. Something wrong,” and
the silence hung on the table.
There was a shuffle behind him. He turned. Lee set a teapot on the table and shuffled away.
Samuel began to talk to push the silence away. He told how he had first come to the valley fresh
from Ireland, but within a few words neither Cathy nor Adam was listening to him. To prove it,
he used a trick he had devised to discover whether his children were listening when they begged
him to read to them and would not let him stop. He threw in two sentences of nonsense. There
was no response from either Adam or Cathy. He gave up.
He bolted his supper, drank his tea scalding hot, and folded his napkin. “Ma’am, if you’ll excuse
me, I’ll ride off home. And I thank you for your hospitality.”
“Good night,” she said.
Adam jumped to his feet, He seemed torn out of a reverie. “Don’t go now. I hoped to persuade
you to stay the night.”
“No, thank you, but that I can’t. And it’s not a long ride. I think—of course, I know—there’ll be a
moon.”
“When will you start the wells?”
“I’ll have to get my rig together, do a piece of sharpening, and put my house in order. In a few
days I’ll send the equipment with Tom.”
The life was flowing back into Adam. “Make it soon,” he said. “I want it soon. Cathy, we’re
going to make the most beautiful place in the world. There’ll be nothing like it anywhere.”
Samuel switched his gaze to Cathy’s face. It did not change. The eyes were flat and the mouth
with its small up-curve at the corners was carven.
“That will be nice,” she said.
For just a moment Samuel had an impulse to do or say something to shock her out of her
distance. He shivered again.
“Another goose?” Adam asked.
“Another goose.” The dusk was falling and already the tree forms were dark against the sky.
“Good night, then.”
“I’ll walk down with you.”
“No, stay with your wife. You haven’t finished your supper.”
“But I—”
“Sit down, man. I can find my own horse, and if I can’t I’ll steal one of yours.” Samuel pushed
Adam gently down in his chair. “Good night. Good night. Good night, ma’am.” He walked
quickly toward the shed.
Old platter-foot Doxology was daintily nibbling hay from the manger with lips like two
flounders. The halter chain clinked against wood. Samuel lifted down his saddle from the big nail
where it hung by one wooden stirrup and swung it over the broad back. He was lacing the látigo

through the cinch rings when there was a small stir behind him. He turned and saw the silhouette
of Lee against the last light from the open shadows.
“When you come back?” the Chinese asked softly.
“I don’t know. In a few days or a week. Lee, what is it?”
“What is what?”
“By God, I got creepy! Is there something wrong here?”
“What do you mean?”
“You know damn well what I mean.”
“Chinee boy jus’ workee—not hear, not talkee.”
‘‘Yes. I guess you’re right. Sure, you’re right. Sorry I asked you. It wasn’t very good manners.”
He turned back, slipped the bit in Dox’s mouth, and laced the big flop ears into the headstall. He
slipped the halter and dropped it in the manger. “Good night, Lee,” he said.
“Mr. Hamilton—”
“Yes?”
“Do you need a cook?”
“On my place I can’t afford a cook?”
“I’d work cheap.”
“Liza would kill you. Why—you want to quit?”
“Just thought I’d ask,” said Lee. “Good night.”

Adam and Cathy sat in the gathering dark under the tree.
“He’s a good man,” Adam said. “I like him. I wish I could persuade him to take over here and run
this place—kind of superintendent.”
Cathy said, “He’s got his own place and his own family.”
“Yes, I know. And it’s the poorest land you ever saw. He could make more at wages from me. I’ll
ask him. It does take a time to get used to a new country. It’s like being born again and having to
learn all over. I used to know from what quarter the rains came. It’s different here. And once I
knew in my skin whether wind would blow, when it would be cold. But I’ll learn. It just takes a
little time. Are you comfortable, Cathy?”
“Yes.”
“One day, and not too far away, you’ll see the whole valley green with alfalfa—see it from the
fine big win-dows of the finished house. I’ll plant rows of gum trees, and I’m going to send away
for seeds and plants—put in a kind of experimental farm. I might try lichee nuts from China. I
wonder if they would grow here. Well, I can try. Maybe Lee could tell me. And once the baby’s
born you can ride over the whole place with me. You haven’t really seen it. Did I tell you? Mr.
Hamilton is going to put up windmills, and we’ll be able to see them turning from here.” He
stretched his legs out com-fortably under the table. “Lee should bring candles,” he said. “I
wonder what’s keeping him.”
Cathy spoke very quietly. “Adam, I didn’t want to come here. I am not going to stay here. As

soon as I can I will go away.”
“Oh, nonsense.” He laughed. “You’re like a child away from home for the first time. You’ll love
it once you get used to it and the baby is born. You know, when I first went away to the army I
thought I was going to die of homesickness. But I got over it. We all get over it. So don’t say silly
things like that.”
“It’s not a silly thing.”
“Don’t talk about it, dear. Everything will change after the baby is born. You’ll see. You’ll see.”
He clasped his hands behind his head and looked up at the faint stars through the tree branches.

Chapter 16
1
Samuel Hamilton rode back home in a night so flooded with moonlight that the hills took on the
quality of the white and dusty moon. The trees and earth were moon-dry, silent and airless and
dead. The shadows were black without shading and the open places white without color. Here
and there Samuel could see secret movement, for the moon-feeders were at work—the deer
which browse all night when the moon is clear and sleep under thickets in the day. Rabbits and
field mice and all other small hunted that feel safer in the con-cealing light crept and hopped and
crawled and froze to resemble stones or small bushes when ear or nose sus-pected danger. The
predators were working too—the long weasels like waves of brown light; the cobby wild-cats
crouching near to the ground, almost invisible except when their yellow eyes caught light and
flashed for a second; the foxes, sniffling with pointed up-raised noses for a warm-blooded supper;
the raccoons padding near still water, talking frogs. The coyotes nuzzled along the slopes and,
torn with sorrow-joy, raised their heads and shouted their feeling, half keen, half laugh-ter, at
their goddess moon. And over all the shadowy screech owls sailed, drawing a smudge of
shadowy fear below them on the ground. The wind of the afternoon was gone and only a little
breeze like a sigh was stirred by the restless thermals of the warm, dry hills.
Doxology’s loud off-beat hoofsteps silenced the night people until after he had passed. Samuel’s
beard glinted white, and his graying hair stood up high on his head. He had hung his black hat on
his saddle horn. An ache was on the top of his stomach, an apprehension that was like a sick
thought. It was a Weltschmerz—which we used to call “Welshrats”—the world sadness that rises
into the soul like a gas and spreads despair so that you probe for the offending event and can find
none.
Samuel went back in his mind over the fine ranch and the indications of water—no Welshrats
could come out of that unless he sheltered a submerged envy. He looked in himself for envy and
could find none. He went on to Adam’s dream of a garden like Eden and to Adam’s adoration of
Cathy. Nothing there unless—unless his secret mind brooded over his own healed loss. But that
was so long ago he had forgotten the pain. The memory was mellow and warm and com-fortable,
now that it was all over. His loins and his thighs had forgotten hunger.
As he rode through the light and dark of tree-shade and open his mind moved on. When had the
Welshrats started crawling in his chest? He found it then—and it was Cathy, pretty, tiny, delicate
Cathy. But what about her? She was silent, but many women were silent. What was it? Where
had it come from? He remembered that he had felt an imminence akin to the one that came to him
when he held the water wand. And he remembered the shivers when the goose walked over his
grave. Now he had pinned it down in time and place and person. It had come at dinner and it had

come from Cathy.
He built her face in front of him and studied her wide-set eyes, delicate nostrils, mouth smaller
than he liked but sweet, small firm chin, and back to her eyes. Were they cold? Was it her eyes?
He was circling to the point. The eyes of Cathy had no message, no communi-cation of any kind.
There was nothing recognizable behind them. They were not human eyes. They remind-ed him of
something—what was it?—some memory, some picture. He strove to find it and then it came of
itself.
It rose out of the years complete with all its colors and its cries, its crowded feelings. He saw
himself, a very little boy, so small that he had to reach high for his father’s hand. He felt the
cobbles of Londonderry under his feet and the crush and gaiety of the one big city he had seen. A
fair, it was, with puppet shows and stalls of produce and horses and sheep penned right in the
street for sale or trade or auction, and other stalls of bright-colored knickknackery, desirable, and
because his father was gay, almost possessable.
And then the people turned like a strong river, and they were carried along a narrow street as
though they were chips on a flood tide, pressure at chest and back and the feet keeping up. The
narrow street opened out to a square, and against the gray wall of a building there was a high
structure of timbers and a noosed rope hanging down.
Samuel and his father were pushed and bunted by the water of people, pushed closer and closer.
He could hear in his memory ear his father saying, “It’s no thing for a child. It’s no thing for
anybody, but less for a child.” His father struggled to turn, to force his way back against the flood
wave of people. “Let us out. Please let us out. I’ve a child here.”
The wave was faceless and it pushed without pas-sion. Samuel raised his head to look at the
structure. A group of dark-clothed, dark-hatted men had climbed up on the high platform. And in
their midst was a man with golden hair, dressed in dark trousers and a light blue shirt open at the
throat. Samuel and his father were so close that the boy had to raise his head high to see.
The golden man seemed to have no arms. He looked out over the crowd and then looked down,
looked right at Samuel. The picture was clear, lighted and perfect. The man’s eyes had no depth—
they were not like other eyes, not like the eyes of a man.
Suddenly there was quick movement on the plat-form, and Samuel’s father put both his hands on
the boy’s head so that his palms cupped over the ears and his fingers met behind. The hands
forced Samuel’s head down and forced his face tight in against his father’s black best coat.
Struggle as he would, he could not move his head. He could see only a band of light around the
edges of his eyes and only a muffled roar of sound came to his ears through his father’s hands. He
heard heartbeats in his hears. Then he felt his father’s hands and arms grow rigid with set
muscles, and against his face he could feel his father’s deep-caught breathing and then deep
intake and held breath, and his father’s hands, trembling.
A little more there was to it, and he dug it up and set it before his eyes in the air ahead of the
horse’s head—a worn and battered table at a pub, loud talk and laughter. A pewter mug was in
front of his father, and a cup of hot milk, sweet and aromatic with sugar and cinnamon, before
himself. His father’s lips were curi-ously blue and there were tears in his father’s eyes.

“I’d never have brought you if I’d known. It’s not fit for any man to see, and sure not for a small
boy.”
“I didn’t see any,” Samuel piped. “You held my head down.”
“I’m glad of that.”
“What was it?”
“I’ll have to tell you. They were killing a bad man.”
“Was it the golden man?”
“Yes, it was. And you must put no sorrow on him. He had to be killed. Not once but many times
he did dreadful things—things only a fiend could think of. It’s not his hanging sorrows me but
that they make a holiday of it that should be done secretly, in the dark.”
“I saw the golden man. He looked right down at me.”
“For that even more I thank God he’s gone.”
“What did he do?”
“I’ll never tell you nightmare things.”
“He had the strangest eyes, the golden man. They put me in mind of a goat’s eyes.”
“Drink your sweety-milk and you shall have a stick with ribbons and a long whistle like silver.”
“And the shiny box with a picture into it?”
“That also, so you drink up your sweety-milk and beg no more.”
There it was, mined out of the dusty past.
Doxology was climbing the last rise before the hol-low of the home ranch and the big feet
stumbled over stones in the roadway.
It was the eyes, of course, Samuel thought. Only twice in my life have I seen eyes like that—not
like human eyes. And he thought, It’s the night and the moon. Now what connection under
heaven can there be between the golden man hanged so long ago and the sweet little bearing
mother? Liza’s right. My imagina-tion will get me a passport to hell one day. Let me dig this
nonsense out, else I’ll be searching that poor child for evil. This is how we can get trapped. Now
think hard and then lose it. Some accident of eye shape and eye color, it is. But no, that’s not it.
It’s a look and has no reference to shape or color. Well, why is a look evil then? Maybe such a
look may have been sometime on a holy face. Now, stop this romancing and never let it trouble
again—ever. He shivered. I’ll have to set up a goose fence around my grave, he thought.
And Samuel Hamilton resolved to help greatly with the Salinas Valley Eden, to make a secret
guilt-payment for his ugly thoughts.

Liza Hamilton, her apple cheeks flaming red, moved like a caged leopard in front of the stove
when Samuel came into the kitchen in the morning. The oakwood fire roared up past an open
damper to heat the oven for the bread, which lay white and rising in the pans. Liza had been up
before dawn. She always was. It was just as sinful to her to lie abed after light as it was to be
abroad after dark. There was no possible virtue in either. Only one person in the world could with
impuni-ty and without crime lie between her crisp ironed sheets after dawn, after sunup, even to

the far reaches of midmorning, and that was her youngest and last born, Joe. Only Tom and Joe
lived on the ranch now. And Tom, big and red, already cultivating a fine flowing mustache, sat at
the kitchen table with his sleeves rolled down as he had been mannered. Liza poured thick batter
from a pitcher onto a soapstone griddle. The hot cakes rose like little hassocks, and small
volcanos formed and erupted on them until they were ready to be turned. A cheerful brown, they
were, with tracings of darker brown. And the kitchen was full of the good sweet smell of them.
Samuel came in from the yard where he had been washing himself. His face and beard gleamed
with water, and he turned down the sleeves of his blue shirt as he entered the kitchen. Rolled-up
sleeves at the table were not acceptable to Mrs. Hamilton. They indi-cated either an ignorance or
a flouting of the niceties.
“I’m late, Mother,” Samuel said.
She did not look around at him. Her spatula moved like a striking snake and the hot cakes settled
their white sides hissing on the soapstone. “What time was it you came home?” she asked.
“Oh, it was late—late. Must have been near eleven. I didn’t look, fearing to waken you.”
“I did not waken,” Liza said grimly. “And maybe you can find it healthy to rove all night, but the
Lord God will do what He sees fit about that.” It was well known that Liza Hamilton and the
Lord God held similar convictions on nearly every subject. She turned and reached and a plate of
crisp hot cakes lay between Tom’s hands. “How does the Sanchez place look?” she asked.
Samuel went to his wife, leaned down from his height, and kissed her round red cheek. “Good
morn-ing, Mother. Give me your blessing.”
“Bless you,” said Liza automatically.
Samuel sat down at the table and said, “Bless you, Tom. Well, Mr. Trask is making great
changes. He’s fitting up the old house to live in.”
Liza turned sharply from the stove. “The one where the cows and pigs have slept the years?”
“Oh, he’s ripped out the floors and window casings. All new and new painted.”
“He’ll never get the smell of pigs out,” Liza said firmly. “There’s a pungency left by a pig that
nothing can wash out or cover up.”
“Well, I went inside and looked around, Mother, and I could smell nothing except paint.”
“When the paint dries you’ll smell pig,” she said.
“He’s got a garden laid out with spring water run-ning through it, and he’s set a place apart for
flowers, roses and the like, and some of the bushes are coming clear from Boston.”
“I don’t see how the Lord God puts up with such waste,” she said grimly. “Not that I don’t like a
rose myself.”
“He said he’d try to root some cuttings for me,” Samuel said.
Tom finished his hot cakes and stirred his coffee. “What kind of a man is he, Father?”
“Well, I think he’s a fine man—has a good tongue and a fair mind. He’s given to dreaming—”
“Hear now the pot blackguarding the kettle,” Liza interrupted.
“I know, Mother, I know. But have you ever thought that my dreaming takes the place of
something I haven’t? Mr. Trask has practical dreams and the sweet dollars to make them solid.
He wants to make a garden of his land, and he will do it too.”

“What’s his wife like?” Liza asked.
“Well, she’s very young and very pretty. She’s quiet, hardly speaks, but then she’s having her
first baby soon.”
“I know that,” Liza said. “What was her name be-fore?”
“I don’t know.”
“Well, where did she come from?”
“I don’t know.”
She put his plate of hot cakes in front of him and poured coffee in his cup and refilled Tom’s cup.
“What did you learn then? How does she dress?”
“Why, very nice, pretty—a blue dress and a little coat, pink but tight about the waist.”
“You’ve an eye for that. Would you say they were made clothes or store bought?”
“Oh, I think store bought.”
“You would not know,” Liza said firmly. “You thought the traveling suit Dessie made to go to
San Jose was store bought.”
“Dessie’s the clever love,” said Samuel. “A needle sings in her hands.”
Tom said, “Dessie’s thinking of opening a dressmak-ing shop in Salinas.”
“She told me,” Samuel said. “She’d make a great success of it.”
“Salinas?” Liza put her hands on her hips. “Dessie didn’t tell me.”
“I’m afraid we’ve done bad service to our dearie,” Samuel said. “Here she wanted to save it for a
real tin-plate surprise to her mother and we’ve leaked it like wheat from a mouse-hole sack.”
“She might have told me,” said Liza. “I don’t like surprises. Well, go on—what was she doing?”
“Who?”
“Why, Mrs. Trask of course.”
“Doing? Why, sitting, sitting in a chair under an oak tree. Her time’s not far.”
“Her hands, Samuel, her hands—what was she doing with her hands?”
Samuel searched his memory. “Nothing I guess. I remember—she had little hands and she held
them clasped in her lap.”
Liza sniffed. “Not sewing, not mending, not knit-ting?”
“No, Mother.”
“I don’t know that it’s a good idea for you to go over there. Riches and idleness, devil’s tools,
and you’ve not a very sturdy resistance.”
Samuel raised his head and laughed with pleasure. Sometimes his wife delighted him but he
could never tell her how. “It’s only the riches I’ll be going there for, Liza. I meant to tell you after
breakfast so you could sit down to hear. He wants me to bore four or five wells for him, and
maybe put windmills and storage tanks.”
“Is it all talk? Is it a windmill turned by water? Will he pay you or will you come back excusing
as usual? ‘He’ll pay when his crop comes in,’ ” she mimicked, “ ‘He’ll pay when his rich uncle
dies.’ It’s my experi-ence, Samuel, and should be yours, that if they don’t pay presently they
never pay at all. We could buy a valley farm with your promises.”
“Adam Trask will pay,” said Samuel. “He’s well fixed. His father left him a fortune. It’s a whole

winter of work, Mother. We’ll lay something by and we’ll have a Christmas to scrape the stars.
He’ll pay fifty cents a foot, and the windmills, Mother. I can make everything but the casings
right here. I’ll need the boys to help. I want to take Tom and Joe.”
“Joe can’t go,” she said. “You know he’s delicate.”
“I thought I might scrape off some of his delicacy. He can starve on delicacy.”
“Joe can’t go,” she said finally. “And who is to run the ranch while you and Tom are gone?”
“I thought I’d ask George to come back. He doesn’t like a clerk’s job even if it is in King City.”
“Like it he may not, but he can take a measure of discomfort for eight dollars a week.”
“Mother,” Samuel cried, “here’s our chance to scratch our name in the First National Bank!
Don’t throw the weight of your tongue in the path of fortune. Please, Mother!”
She grumbled to herself all morning over her work while Tom and Samuel went over the boring
equip-ment, sharpened bits, drew sketches of windmills new in design, and measured for timbers
and redwood water tanks. In the midmorning Joe came out to join them, and he became so
fascinated that he asked Samuel to let him go.
Samuel said, “Offhand I’d say I’m against it, Joe. Your mother needs you here.”
“But I want to go, Father. And don’t forget, next year I’ll be going, to college in Palo Alto. And
that’s going away, isn’t it? Please let me go. I’ll work hard.”
“I’m sure you would if you could come. But I’m against it. And when you talk to your mother
about it, I’ll thank you to let it slip that I’m against it. You might even throw in that I refused
you.”
Joe grinned, and Tom laughed aloud.
“Will you let her persuade you?” Tom asked.
Samuel scowled at his sons. “I’m a hard-opinioned man,” he said. “Once I’ve set my mind, oxen
can’t stir me. I’ve looked at it from all angles and my word is—Joe can’t go. You wouldn’t want
to make a liar of my word, would you?”
“I’ll go in and talk to her now,” said Joe.
“Now, son, take it easy,” Samuel called after him. “Use your head. Let her do most of it.
Meanwhile I’ll set my stubborn up.”
Two days later the big wagon pulled away, loaded with timbers and tackle. Tom drove four
hordes, and beside him Samuel and Joe sat swinging their feet.

Chapter 17
1
When I said Cathy was a monster it seemed to me that it was so. Now I have bent close with a
glass over the small print of her and reread the footnotes, and I wonder if it was true. The trouble
is that since we cannot know what she wanted, we will never know whether or not she got it. If
rather than running toward something, she ran away from something, we can’t know whether she
escaped. Who knows but that she tried to tell someone or everyone what she was like and could
not, for lack of a common language. Her life may have been her language, formal, developed,
indecipher-able. It is easy to say she was bad, but there is little meaning unless we know why.
I’ve built the image in my mind of Cathy, sitting quietly waiting for her pregnancy to be over,
living on a farm she did not like, with a man she did not love.
She sat in her chair under the oak tree, her hands clasped each to each in love and shelter. She
grew very big—abnormally big, even at a time when women glo-ried in big babies and counted
extra pounds with pride. She was misshapen; her belly, tight and heavy and distended, made it
impossible for her to stand without supporting herself with her hands. But the great lump was
local. Shoulders, neck, arms, hands, face, were unaffected, slender and girlish. Her breasts did not
grow and her nipples did not darken. There was no quickening of milk glands, no physical
planning to feed the newborn. When she sat behind a table you could not see that she was
pregnant at all.
In that day there was no measuring of pelvic arch, no testing of blood, no building with calcium.
A wom-an gave a tooth for a child. It was the law. And a woman was likely to have strange
tastes, some said for filth, and it was set down to the Eve nature still under sentence for original
sin.
Cathy’s odd appetite was simple compared to some. The carpenters, repairing the old house,
complained that they could not keep the lumps of chalk with which they coated their chalk lines.
Again and again the scored hunks disappeared. Cathy stole them and broke them in little pieces.
She carried the chips in her apron pocket, and when no one was about she crushed the soft lime
between her teeth. She spoke very little. Her eyes were remote. It was as though she had gone
away, leaving a breathing doll to conceal her absence.
Activity surged around her. Adam went happily about building and planning his Eden. Samuel
and his boys brought in a well at forty feet and put down the newfangled expensive metal casing,
for Adam wanted the best.
The Hamiltons moved their rig and started another hole. They slept in a tent beside the work and
cooked over a campfire. But there was always one or another of them riding home for a tool or
with a message.

Adam fluttered like a bewildered bee confused by too many flowers. He sat by Cathy and chatted
about the pieplant roots just come in. He sketched for her the new fan blade Samuel had invented
for the windmill. It had a variable pitch and was an unheard-of thing. He rode out to the well rig
and slowed the work with his interest. And naturally, as he discussed wells with Cathy, his talk
was all of birth and child care at the well head. It was a good time for Adam, the best time. He
was the king of his wide and spacious life. And summer passed into a hot and fragrant autumn.

2
The Hamiltons at the well rig had finished their lunch of Liza’s bread and rat cheese and
venomous coffee cooked in a can over the fire. Joe’s eyes were heavy and he was considering
how he could get away into the brush to sleep for a while.
Samuel knelt in the sandy soil, looking at the torn and broken edges of his bit. Just before they
had stopped for lunch the drill had found something thirty feet down that had mangled the steel as
though it were lead. Samuel scraped the edge of the blade with his pocketknife and inspected the
scrapings in the palm of his hand His eyes shone with a childlike excitement. He held out his
hand and poured the scrapings into Tom’s hand.
“Take a look at it, son. What do you think it is?”
Joe wandered over from his place in front of the tent. Tom studied the fragments in his hand.
“Whatever it is, it’s hard,” he said. “Couldn’t be a diamond that big. Looks like metal. Do you
think we’ve bored into a buried locomotive?”
His father laughed. “Thirty feet down,” he said ad-miringly.
“It looks like tool steel,” said Tom. “We haven’t got anything that can touch it.” Then he saw the
faraway joyous look on his father’s face and a shiver of shared delight came to him. The
Hamilton children loved it when their father’s mind went free. Then the world was peopled with
wonders.
Samuel said, “Metal, you say. You think, steel. Tom, I’m going to make a guess and then I’m
going to get an assay. Now hear my guess—and remember it. I think we’ll find nickel in it, and
silver maybe, and carbon and manganese. How I would like to dig it up! It’s in sea sand. That’s
what we’ve been getting.”
Tom said, “Say, what do you think it is with—nickel and silver—”
“It must have been long thousand centuries ago,” Samuel said, and his sons knew he was seeing
it. “Maybe it was all water here—an inland sea with the seabirds circling and crying. And it
would have been a pretty thing if it happened at night. There would come a line of light and then
a pencil of white light and then a tree of blinding light drawn in a long arc from heav-en. Then
there’d be a great water spout and a big mushroom of steam. And your ears would be staggered
by the sound because the soaring cry of its coming would be on you at the same time the water
exploded. And then it would be black night again, because of the blinding light. And gradually
you’d see the killed fish coming up, showing silver in the starlight, and the cry-ing birds would
come to eat them. It’s a lonely, lovely thing to think about, isn’t it?”
He made them see it as he always did.

Tom said softly, “You think it’s a meteorite, don’t you?”
“That I do. and we can prove it by assay.”
Joe said eagerly, “Let’s dig it up.”
“You dig it, Joe, while we bore for water.”
Tom said seriously, “If the assay showed enough nickel and silver, wouldn’t it pay to mine it?”
“You’re my own son,” said Samuel. “We don’t know whether it’s big as a house or little as a hat.”
“But we could probe down and see.”
“That we could if we did it secretly and hid our thinking under a pot.”
“Why, what do you mean?”
“Now, Tom, have you no kindness toward your mother? We give her enough trouble, son. She’s
told me plain that if I spend any more money patenting things, she’ll give us trouble to remember.
Have pity on her! Can’t you see her shame when they ask her what we’re doing? She’s a truthful
woman, your mother. She’d have to say, ‘They’re at digging up a star.’ ” He laughed happily.
“She’d never live it down. And she’d make us smart. No pies for three months.”
Tom said, “We can’t get through it. We’ll have to move to another place.”
“I’ll put some blasting powder down,” said his fa-ther, “and if that doesn’t crack it aside we’ll
start a new hole.” He stood up. “I’ll have to go home for powder and to sharpen the drill. Why
don’t you boys ride along with me and we’ll give Mother a surprise so that she’ll cook the whole
night and complain. That way she’ll dissemble her pleasure.”
Joe said, “Somebody’s coming, coming fast.” And indeed they could see a horseman riding
toward them at full gallop, but a curious horseman who flopped about on his mount like a tied
chicken. When he came a little closer they saw that it was Lee, his elbows waving like wings, his
queue lashing about like a snake. It was surprising that he stayed on at all and still drove the
horse at full tilt. He pulled up, breathing heavily. “Missy Adam say come! Missy Cathy bad—
come quick. Missy yell, scream.”
Samuel said, “Hold on, Lee. When did it start?”
“Mebbe bleakfus time.”
“All right. Calm yourself. How is Adam?”
“Missy Adam clazy. Cly—laugh—make vomit.”
“Sure,” said Samuel. “These new fathers. I was one once. Tom, throw a saddle on for me, will
you?”
Joe said, “What is it?”
“Why, Mrs. Trask is about to have her baby. I told Adam I’d stand by.”
“You?” Joe asked.
Samuel leveled his eyes on his youngest son. “I brought both of you into the world,” he said.
“And you’ve given no evidence you think I did a bad service to the world. Tom, you get all the
tools gathered up. And go back to the ranch and sharpen the metal. Bring back the box of powder
that’s on the shelf in the tool shed, and go easy with it as you love your arms and legs. Joe, I want
you to stay here and look after things.”
Joe said plaintively, “But what will I do here alone?”

Samuel was silent for a moment. Then he said, “Joe, do you love me?”
“Why, sure.”
“If you heard I’d committed some great crime would you turn me over to the police?”
“What are you talking about?”
“Would you?”
“No.”
“All right then. In my basket, under my clothes, you’ll find two books—new, so be gentle with
them. It’s two volumes by a man the world is going to hear from. You can start reading if you
want and it will raise up your lid a little. It’s called The Principles of Psychology and it’s by an
Eastern man named William James. No relative to the train robber. And, Joe, if you ever let on
about the books I’ll run you off the ranch. If your mother ever found out I spent the money on
them she’d run me off the ranch.”
Tom led a saddled horse to him. “Can I read it next?”
“Yes,” said Samuel, and he slipped his leg lightly over the saddle. “Come on, Lee.”
The Chinese wanted to break into a gallop but Sam-uel restrained him. “Take it easy, Lee.
Birthing takes longer than you think, mostly.”
For a time they rode in silence, and then Lee said, “I’m sorry you bought those books. I have the
con-densed form, in one volume, the textbook. You could have borrowed it.”
“Have you now? Do you have many books?”
“Not many here—thirty or forty. But you’re wel-come to any of them you haven’t read.”
“Thank you, Lee. And you may be sure I’ll look the first moment I can. You know, you could
talk to my boys. Joe’s a little flighty but Tom’s all right and it would do him good.”
“It’s a hard bridge to cross, Mr. Hamilton. Makes me timid to talk to a new person, but I’ll try if
you say so.”
They walked the horses rapidly toward the little draw of the Trask place. Samuel said, “Tell me,
how is it with the mother?”
“I’d rather you saw for yourself and thought for yourself,” Lee said. “You know when a man
lives alone as much as I do, his mind can go off on an irrational tangent just because his social
world is out of kilter.”
“Yes, I know. But I’m not lonely and I’m on a tangent too. But maybe not the same one.”
“You don’t think I imagine it then?”
“I don’t know what it is, but I’ll tell you for your reassurance that I’ve a sense of strangeness.”
“I guess that’s all it is with me too,” said Lee. He smiled. “I’ll tell you how far it got with me
though. Since I’ve come here I find myself thinking of Chinese fairy tales my father told me. We
Chinese have a well-developed demonology.”
“You think she is a demon?”
“Of course not,” said Lee. “I hope I’m a little be-yond such silliness. I don’t know what it is. You
know, Mr. Hamilton, a servant develops an ability to taste the wind and judge the climate of the
house he works in. And there’s a strangeness here. Maybe that’s what makes me remember my
father’s demons.”

“Did your father believe in them?”
“Oh, no. He thought I should know the background. You Occidentals perpetuate a good many
myths too.”
Samuel said, “Tell me what happened to set you off. This morning, I mean.”
“If you weren’t coming I would try,” said Lee. “But I would rather not. You can see for yourself.
I may be crazy. Of course Mr. Adam is strung so tight he may snap like a banjo string.”
“Give me a little hint. It might save time. What did she do?”
“Nothing. That’s just it. Mr. Hamilton, I’ve been at births before, a good many of them, but this
is some-thing new to me.”
“How?”
“It’s—well—I’ll tell you the one thing I can think of. This is much more like a bitter, deadly
combat than a birth.”
As they rode into the draw and under the oak trees Samuel said, “I hope you haven’t got me in a
state, Lee. It’s a strange day, and I don’t know why.”
“No wind,” said Lee. “It’s the first day in a month when there hasn’t been wind in the afternoon.”
“That’s so. You know I’ve been so close to the details I’ve paid no attention to the clothing of the
day. First we find a buried star and now we go to dig up a mint-new human.” He looked up
through the oak branches at the yellow-lit hills. “What a beautiful day to be born in!” he said. “If
signs have their fingers on a life, it’s a sweet life coming. And, Lee, if Adam plays true, he’ll be
in the way. Stay close, will you? In case I need something. Look, the men, the carpenters, are
sitting under that tree.”
“Mr. Adam stopped the work. He thought the hammering might disturb his wife.”
Samuel said, “You stay close. That sounds like Adam playing true. He doesn’t know his wife
probably couldn’t hear God Himself beating a tattoo on the sky.”
The workmen sitting under the tree waved to him. “How do, Mr. Hamilton. How’s your family?”
“Fine, fine. Say, isn’t that Rabbit Holman? Where’ve you been, Rabbit?”
“Went prospecting, Mr. Hamilton.”
“Find anything, Rabbit?”
“Hell, Mr. Hamilton, I couldn’t even find the mule I went out with.”
They rode on toward the house. Lee said quickly, “If you ever get a minute, I’d like to show you
some-thing.”
“What is it, Lee?”
“Well, I’ve been trying to translate some old Chinese poetry into English. I’m not sure it can be
done. Will you take a look?”
“I’d like to, Lee. Why, that would be a treat for me.”

3
Bordoni’s white frame house was very quiet, almost broodingly quiet, and the shades were pulled
down. Samuel dismounted at the stoop, untied his bulging saddlebags, and gave his horse to Lee.
He knocked and got no answer and went in. It was dusky in the living room after the outside

light. He looked in the kitchen, scrubbed to the wood grain by Lee. A gray stoneware pilon
coffeepot grunted on the back of the stove. Sam-uel tapped lightly on the bedroom door and went
in.
It was almost pitch-black inside, for not only were the shades down but blankets were tacked over
the windows. Cathy was lying in the big four-poster bed, and Adam sat beside her, his face buried
in the cover-let. He raised his head and looked blindly out.
Samuel said pleasantly, “Why are you sitting in the dark?”
Adam’s voice was hoarse. “She doesn’t want the light. It hurts her eyes.”
Samuel walked into the room and authority grew in him with each step. “There will have to be
lieht,” he said. “She can close her eyes. I’ll tie a black cloth over them if she wants.” He moved to
the window and grasped the blanket to pull it down, but Adam was upon him before he could
yank.
“Leave it. The light hurts her,” he said fiercely.
Samuel turned on him. “Now, Adam, I know what you feel. I promised you I’d take care of
things, and I will. I only hope one of those things isn’t you.” He pulled the blanket down and
rolled up the shade to let the golden afternoon light in.
Cathy made a little mewing sound from the bed, and Adam went to her. “Close your eyes, dear.
I’ll put a cloth over your eyes.”
Samuel dropped his saddlebags in a chair and stood beside the bed. “Adam,” he said firmly, “I’m
going to ask you to go out of the room and to stay out.”
“No, I can’t. Why?”
“Because I don’t want you in the way. It’s consid-ered a sweet practice for you to get drunk.”
“I couldn’t.”
Samuel said, “Anger’s a slow thing in me and disgust is slower, but I can taste the beginnings of
both of them. You’ll get out of the room and give me no trouble or I’ll go away and you’ll have a
basket of trouble.”
Adam went finally, and from the doorway Samuel called, “And I don’t want you bursting in if
you hear anything. You wait for me to come out.” He closed the door, noticed there was a key in
the lock, and turned it. “He’s an upset, vehement man,” he said. “He loves you.”
He had not looked at her closely until now. And he saw true hatred in her eyes, unforgiving,
murderous hatred.
“It’ll be over before long, dearie. Now tell me, has the water broke?”
Her hostile eyes glared at him and her lips raised snarling from her little teeth. She did not answer
him.
He stared at her. “I did not come by choice except as a friend,” he said. “It’s not a pleasure to me,
young woman. I don’t know your trouble and minute by minute I don’t care. Maybe I can save
you some pain—who knows? I’m going to ask you one more question. If you don’t answer, if
you put that snarling look on me, I’m going out and leave you to welter.”
The words struck into her understanding like lead shot dropping in water. She made a great effort.
And it gave him a shivering to see her face change, the steel leave her eyes, the lips thicken from

line to bow, and the corners turn up. He noticed a movement of her hands, the fists unclench and
the fingers turn pinkly upward. Her face became young and innocent and bravely hurt. It was like
one magic-lantern slide taking the place of another.
She said softly, “The water broke at dawn.”
“That’s better. Have you had hard labor?”
“Yes.”
“How far apart?”
“I don’t know.”
“Well, I’ve been in this room fifteen minutes.”
“I’ve had two little ones—no big ones since you came.”
“Fine. Now where’s your linen?”
“In that hamper over there.”
“You’ll be all right, dearie,” he said gently.
He opened his saddlebags and took out a thick rope covered with blue velvet and looped at either
end. On the velvet hundreds of little pink flowers were em-broidered. “Liza sent you her pulling
rope to use,” he said. “She made it when our first-born was preparing. What with our children and
friends’, this rope has pulled a great number of people into the world.” He slipped one of the
loops over each of the footposts of the bed.
Suddenly her eyes glazed and her back arched like a spring and the blood started to her cheeks.
He waited for her cry or scream and looked apprehensively at the closed door. But there was no
scream—only a series of grunting squeals. After a few seconds her body relaxed and the
hatefulness was back in her face.
The labor struck again. “There’s a dear,” he said soothingly. “Was it one or two? I don’t know.
The more you see, the more you learn no two are alike. I’d better get my hands washed.”
Her head threshed from side to side. “Good, good, my darling,” he said. “I think it won’t be long
till your baby’s here.” He put his hand on her forehead where her scar showed dark and angry.
“How did you get the hurt on your head?” he asked.
Her head jerked up and her sharp teeth fastened on his hand across the back and up into the palm
near the little finger. He cried out in pain and tried to pull his hand away, but her jaw was set and
her head twisted and turned, mangling his hand the way a terrier worries a sack. A shrill snarling
came from her set teeth. He slapped her on the cheek and it had no effect. Automat-ically he did
what he would have done to stop a dog fight. His left hand went to her throat and he cut off her
wind. She struggled and tore at his hand before her jaws unclenched and he pulled his hand free.
The flesh was torn and bleeding. He stepped back from the bed and looked at the damage her
teeth had done. He looked at her with fear. And when he looked, her face was calm again and
young and innocent.
“I’m sorry,” she said quickly. “Oh, I’m sorry.”
Samuel shuddered.
“It was the pain,” she said.
Samuel laughed shortly. “I’ll have to muzzle you, I guess,” he said. “A collie bitch did the same

to me once.” He saw the hatred look out of her eyes for a second and then retreat.
Samuel said, “Have you got anything to put on it? Humans are more poisonous than snakes.”
“I don’t know.”
“Well, have you got any whisky? I’ll pour some whisky on it.”
“In the second drawer.”
He splashed whisky on his bleeding hand and knead-ed the flesh against the alcohol sting. A
strong quaking was in his stomach and a sickness rose up against his eyes. He took a swallow of
whisky to steady himself. He dreaded to look back at the bed. “My hand won’t be much good for
a while,” he said.
Samuel told Adam afterward, “She must be made of whalebone. The birth happened before I was
ready. Popped like a seed. I’d not the water ready to wash him. Why, she didn’t even touch the
pulling rope to bear down. Pure whalebone, she is.” He tore at the door, called Lee and demanded
warm water. Adam came charging into the room. “A boy!” Samuel cried. “You’ve got a boy!
Easy,” he said, for Adam had seen the mess in the bed and a green was rising in his face.
Samuel said, “Send Lee in here. And you, Adam, if you still have the authority to tell your hands
and feet what to do, get to the kitchen and make me some coffee. And see the lamps are filled and
the chimneys clean.”
Adam turned like a zombie and left the room. In a moment Lee looked in. Samuel pointed to the
bundle in a laundry basket. “Sponge him off in warm water, Lee. Don’t let a draft get on him.
Lord! I wish Liza were here. I can’t do everything at once.”
He turned back to the bed. “Now, dearie, I’ll get you cleaned up.”
Cathy was bowed again, snarling in her pain. “It’ll be over in a little,” he said. “Takes a little time
for the residue. And you’re so quick. Why, you didn’t even have to pull on Liza’s rope.” He saw
something, stared, and went quickly to work. “Lord God in Heaven, it’s another one!”
He worked fast, and as with the first the birth was incredibly quick. And again Samuel tied the
cord. Lee took the second baby, washed it, wrapped it, and put it in the basket.
Samuel cleaned the mother and shifted her gently while he changed the linen on the bed. He
found in himself a reluctance to look in her face. He worked as quickly as he could, for his bitten
hand was stiffening. He drew a clean white sheet up to her chin and raised her to slip a fresh
pillow under her head. At last he had to look at her.
Her golden hair was wet with perspiration but her face had changed. It was stony, expressionless.
At her throat the pulse fluttered visibly.
“You have two sons,” Samuel said. “Two fine sons. They aren’t alike. Each one born separate in
his own sack.”
She inspected him coldly and without interest.
Samuel said, “I’ll show your boys to you.”
“No,” she said without emphasis.
“Now, dearie, don’t you want to see your sons?”
“No. I don’t want them.”
“Oh, you’ll change. You’re tired now, but you’ll change. And I’ll tell you now—this birth was

quicker and easier than I’ve seen ever in my life.”
The eyes moved from his face. “I don’t want them. I want you to cover the windows and take the
light away.”
“It’s weariness. In a few days you’ll feel so different you won’t remember.”
“I’ll remember. Go away. Take them out of the room. Send Adam in.”
Samuel was caught by her tone. There was no sick-ness, no weariness, no softness. His words
came out without his will. “I don’t like you,” he said and wished he could gather the words back
into his throat and into his mind. But his words had no effect on Cathy.
“Send Adam in,” she said.
In the little living room Adam looked vaguely at his sons and went quickly into the bedroom and
shut the door. In a moment came the sound of tapping. Adam was nailing the blankets over the
windows again.
Lee brought coffee to Samuel. “That’s a bad-looking hand you have there,” he said.
“I know. I’m afraid it’s going to give me trouble.”
“Why did she do it?”
“I don’t know. She’s a strange thing.”
Lee said, “Mr. Hamilton, let me take care of that. You could lose an arm.”
The life went out of Samuel. “Do what you want, Lee. A frightened sorrow has closed down over
my heart. I wish I were a child so I could cry. I’m too old to be afraid like this. And I’ve not felt
such despair since a bird died in my hand by a flowing water long ago.”
Lee left the room and shortly returned, carrying a small ebony box carved with twisting dragons.
He sat by Samuel and from his box took a wedge-shaped Chinese razor. “It will hurt,” he said
softly.
“I’ll try to bear it, Lee.”
The Chinese bit his lips, feeling the inflicted pain in himself while he cut deeply into the hand,
opened the flesh around the toothmarks front and back, and trimmed the ragged flesh away until
good red blood flowed from every wound. He shook a bottle of yellow emulsion labeled Hall’s
Cream Salve and poured it into the deep cuts. He saturated a handkerchief with the salve and
wrapped the hand. Samuel winced and gripped the chair arm with his good hand.
“It’s mostly carbolic acid,” Lee said. “You can smell it.”
“Thank you, Lee. I’m being a baby to knot up like this.”
“I don’t think I could have been so quiet,” said Lee. “I’ll get you another cup of coffee.”
He came back with two cups and sat down by Sam-uel. “I think I’ll go away,” he said. “I never
went willingly to a slaughter house.”
Samuel stiffened. “What do you mean?”
“I don’t know. The words came out.”
Samuel shivered. “Lee, men are fools. I guess I hadn’t thought about it, but Chinese men are
fools too.”
“What made you doubt it?”
“Oh, maybe because we think of strangers as strong-er and better than we are.”

“What do you want to say?”
Samuel said, “Maybe the foolishness is necessary, the dragon fighting, the boasting, the pitiful
courage to be constantly knocking a chip off God’s shoulder, and the childish cowardice that
makes a ghost of a dead tree beside a darkening road. Maybe that’s good and neces-sary, but—”
“What do you want to say?” Lee repeated patiently.
“I thought some wind had blown up the embers in my foolish mind,” Samuel said. “And now I
hear in your voice that you have it too. I feel wings over this house. I feel a dreadfulness coming.”
“I feel it too.”
“I know you do, and that makes me take less than my usual comfort in my foolishness. This birth
was too quick, too easy—like a cat having kittens. And I fear for these kittens. I have dreadful
thoughts gnawing to get into my brain.”
“What do you want to say?” Lee asked a third time.
“I want my wife,” Samuel cried. “No dreams, no ghosts, no foolishness. I want her here. They
say miners take canaries into the pits to test the air. Liza has no truck with foolishness. And, Lee,
if Liza sees a ghost, it’s a ghost and not a fragment of a dream. If Liza feels trouble we’ll bar the
doors.”
Lee got up and went to the laundry basket and looked down at the babies. He had to peer close,
for the light was going fast. “They’re sleeping,” he said.
“They’ll be squalling soon enough. Lee, will you hitch up the rig and drive to my place for Liza?
Tell her I need her here. If Tom’s still there, tell him to mind the place. If not, I’ll send him in the
morning. And if Liza doesn’t want to come, tell her we need a woman’s hand here and a
woman’s clear eyes. She’ll know what you mean.”
“I’ll do it,” said Lee. “Maybe we’re scaring each other, like two children in the dark.”
“I’ve thought of that,” Samuel said. “And Lee, tell her I hurt my hand at the well head. Do not,
for God’s sake, tell her how it happened.”
“I’ll get some lamps lit and then I’ll go,” said Lee. “It will be a great relief to have her here.”
“That it will, Lee. That it will. She’ll let some light into this cellar hole.”
After Lee drove away in the dark Samuel picked up a lamp in his left hand. He had to set it on the
floor to turn the knob of the bedroom door. The room was in pitch-blackness, and the yellow
lamplight streamed up-ward and did not light the bed.
Cathy’s voice came strong and edged from the bed. “Shut the door. I do not want the light.
Adam, go out! I want to be in the dark—alone.”
Adam said hoarsely, “I want to stay with you.”
“I do not want you.”
“I will stay.”
“Then stay. But don’t talk any more. Please close the door and take the lamp away.”
Samuel went back to the living room. He put the lamp on the table by the laundry basket and
looked in on the small sleeping faces of the babies. Their eyes were pinched shut and they
sniffled a little in discom-fort at the light. Samuel put his forefinger down and stroked the hot
foreheads. One of the twins opened his mouth and yawned prodigiously and settled back to sleep.

Samuel moved the lamp and then went to the front door and opened it and stepped outside. The
evening star was so bright that it seemed to flare and crumple as it sank toward the western
mountains. The air was still, and Samuel could smell the day-heated sage. The night was very
dark. Samuel started when he heard a voice speaking out of the blackness.
“How is she?”
“Who is it?” Samuel demanded.
“It’s me, Rabbit.” The man emerged and took form in the light from the doorway.
“The mother, Rabbit? Oh, she’s fine.”
“Lee said twins.”
“That’s right—twin sons. You couldn’t want better. I guess Mr. Trask will tear the river up by the
roots now. He’ll bring in a crop of candy canes.”
Samuel didn’t know why he changed the subject. “Rabbit, do you know what we bored into
today? A meteorite.”
“What’s that, Mr. Hamilton?”
“A shooting star that fell a million years ago.”
“You did? Well, think of that! How did you hurt your hand?”
“I almost said on a shooting star.” Samuel laughed. “But it wasn’t that interesting. I pinched it in
the tackle.”
“Bad?”
“No, not bad.”
“Two boys,” said Rabbit. “My old lady will be jealous.”
“Will you come inside and sit, Rabbit?”
“No, no, thank you. I’ll get out to sleep. Morning seems to come earlier every year I live.”
“That it does, Rabbit. Good night then.”
Liza Hamilton arrived about four in the morning. Samuel was asleep in his chair, dreaming that
he had gripped a red-hot bar of iron and could not let go. Liza awakened him and looked at his
hand before she even glanced at the babies. While she did well the things he had done in a
lumbering, masculine way, she gave him his orders and packed him off. He was to get up this
instant, saddle Doxology, and ride straight to King City. No matter what time it was, he must
wake up that good-for-nothing doctor and get his hand treated. If it seemed all right he could go
home and wait. And it was a criminal thing to leave your last-born, and he little more than a baby
himself, sitting there by a hole in the ground with no one to care for him. It was a matter which
might even engage the attention of the Lord God himself.
If Samuel craved realism and activity, he got it. She had him off the place by dawn. His hand was
bandaged by eleven, and he was in his own chair at his own table by five in the afternoon,
sizzling with fever, and Tom was boiling a hen to make chicken soup for him.
For three days Samuel lay in bed, fighting the fever phantoms and putting names to them too,
before his great strength broke down the infection and drove it caterwauling away.”
Samuel looked up at Tom with clear eyes and said, “I’ll have to get up,” tried it and sat weakly
back, chuckling—the sound he made when any force in the world defeated him. He had an idea

that even when beaten he could steal a little victory by laughing at defeat. And Tom brought him
chicken soup until he wanted to kill him. The lore had not died out of the world, and you will still
find people who believe that soup will cure any hurt or illness and is no bad thing to have for the
funeral either.

Liza stayed away a week. She cleaned the Trask house from the top clear down into the grain of
the wooden floors. She washed everything she could bend enough to get into a tub and sponged
the rest. She put the babies on a working basis and noted with satisfaction that they howled most
of the time and began to gain weight. Lee she used like a slave since she didn’t quite believe in
him. Adam she ignored since she couldn’t use him for anything. She did make him wash the
windows and then did it again after he had finished.
Liza sat with Cathy just enough to come to the conclusion that she was a sensible girl who didn’t
talk very much or try to teach her grandmother to suck eggs. She also checked her over and found
that she was perfectly healthy, not injured and not sick, and that she would never nurse the twins.
“And just as well too,” she said. “Those great lummoxes would chew a little thing like you to the
bone.” She forgot that she was smaller than Cathy and had nursed every one of her own children.
On Saturday afternoon Liza checked her work, left a list of instructions as long as her arm to
cover every possibility from colic to an inroad of grease ants, packed her traveling basket, and
had Lee drive her home.
She found her house a stable of filth and abomina-tion and she set to cleaning it with the violence
and disgust of a Hercules at labor. Samuel asked questions of her in flight.
How were the babies?
They were fine, growing.
How was Adam?
Well, he moved around as if he was alive but he left no evidence. The Lord in his wisdom gave
money to very curious people, perhaps because they’d starve without.
How was Mrs. Trask?
Quiet, lackadaisical, like most rich Eastern women (Liza had never known a rich Eastern
woman), but on the other hand docile and respectful. “And it’s a strange thing,” Liza said. “I can
find no real fault with her save perhaps a touch of laziness, and yet I don’t like her very much.
Maybe it’s that scar. How did she get it?”
“I don’t know,” said Samuel.
Liza leveled her forefinger like a pistol between his eyes. “I’ll tell you something. Unbeknownst
to herself, she’s put a spell on her husband. He moons around her like a sick duck. I don’t think
he’s given the twins a thorough good look yet.”
Samuel waited until she went by again. He said, “Well, if she’s lazy and he’s moony, who’s
going to take care of the sweet babies? Twin boys take a piece of looking after.”
Liza stopped in mid-swoop, drew a chair close to him, and sat, resting her hands on her knees.
“Remem-ber I’ve never held the truth lightly if you don’t believe me,” she said.

“I don’t think you could lie, dearie,” he said, and she smiled, thinking it a compliment.
“Well, what I’m to tell you might weigh a little heavy on your belief if you did not know that.”
“Tell me.”
“Samuel, you know that Chinese with his slanty eyes and his outlandish talk and that braid?”
“Lee? Sure I know him.”
“Well, wouldn’t you say offhand he was a heathen?”
“I don’t know.”
“Come now, Samuel, anybody would. But he’s not.” She straightened up.
“What is he?”
She tapped his arm with an iron finger. “A Pres-byterian, and well up—well up, I say, when you
dig it out of that crazy talk. Now what do you think of that?”
Samuel’s voice was unsteady with trying to clamp his laughter in. “No!” he said.
“And I say yes. Well now, who do you think is looking after the twins? I wouldn’t trust a heathen
from here to omega—but a Presbyterian—he learned every-thing I told him.”
“No wonder they’re taking on weight,” said Samuel.
“It’s a matter for praise and it’s a matter for prayer.”
“We’ll do it too,” said Samuel. “Both.”

For a week Cathy rested and gathered her strength. On Saturday of the second week of October
she stayed in her bedroom all morning. Adam tried the door and found it locked.
“I’m busy,” she called, and he went away.
Putting her bureau in order, he thought, for he could hear her opening drawers and closing them.
In the late afternoon Lee came to Adam where he sat on the stoop. “Missy say I go King City buy
nursey bottle,” he said uneasily.
“Well, do it then,” said Adam. “She’s your mistress.”
“Missy say not come back mebbe Monday. Take—”
Cathy spoke calmly from the doorway. “He hasn’t had a day off for a long time. A rest would do
him good.”
“Of course,” said Adam. “I just didn’t think of it. Have a good time. If I need anything I’ll get
one of the carpenters.”
“Men go home, Sunday.”
“I’ll get the Indian. Lopez will help.”
Lee felt Cathy’s eyes on him. “Lopez dlunk. Find bottle whisky.”
Adam said petulantly, “I’m not helpless, Lee. Stop arguing.”
Lee looked at Cathy standing in the doorway. He lowered his eyelids. “Mebbe I come back late,”
he said, and he thought he saw two dark lines appear between her eyes and then disappear. He
turned away. “Goo-by,” he said.
Cathy went back to her room as the evening came down. At seven-thirty Adam knocked. “I’ve
got you some supper, dear. It’s not much.” The door opened as though she had been standing

waiting. She was dressed in her neat traveling dress, the jacket edged in black braid, black velvet
lapels, and large jet buttons. On her head was a wide straw hat with a tiny crown; long jet-beaded
hatpins held it on. Adam’s mouth dropped open.
She gave him no chance to speak. “I’m going away now.”
“Cathy, what do you mean?”
“I told you before.”
“You didn’t.”
“You didn’t listen. It doesn’t matter.”
“I don’t believe you.”
Her voice was dead and metallic. “I don’t give a damn what you believe. I’m going.”
“The babies—”
“Throw them in one of your wells.”
He cried in panic, “Cathy, you’re sick. You can’t go—not from me—not from me.”
“I can do anything to you. Any woman can do anything to you. You’re a fool.”
The word got through his haze. Without warning, his hands reached for her shoulders and he
thrust her backward. As she staggered he took the key from the inside of the door, slammed the
door shut, and locked it.
He stood panting, his ear close to the panel, and a hysterical sickness poisoned him. He could
hear her moving quietly about. A drawer was opened, and the thought leaped in him—she’s
going to stay. And then there was a little click he could not place. His ear was almost touching
the door.
Her voice came from so near that he jerked his head back. He heard richness in her voice. “Dear,”
she said softly, “I didn’t know you would take it so. I’m sorry, Adam.”
His breath burst hoarsely out of his throat. His hand trembled, trying to turn the key, and it fell
out on the floor after he had turned it. He pushed the door open. She stood three feet away. In her
right hand she held his .44 Colt, and the black hole in the barrel pointed at him. He took a step
toward her, saw that the hammer was back.
She shot him. The heavy slug struck him in the shoulder and flattened and tore out a piece of his
shoulderblade. The flash and roar smothered him, and he staggered back and fell to the floor. She
moved slowly toward him, cautiously, as she might toward a wounded animal. He stared up into
her eyes, which inspected him impersonally. She tossed the pistol on the floor beside him and
walked out of the house.
He heard her steps on the porch, on the crisp dry oak leaves on the path, and then he could hear
her no more. And the monotonous sound that had been there all along was the cry of the twins,
wanting their dinner. He had forgotten to feed them.

Chapter 18
1
Horace Quinn was the new deputy sheriff appointed to look after things around the King City
district. He complained that his new job took him away from his ranch too much. His wife
complained even more, but the truth of the matter was that nothing much had happened in a
criminal way since Horace had been deputy. He had seen himself making a name for him-self and
running for sheriff. The sheriff was an impor-tant officer. His job was less flighty than that of
district attorney, almost as permanent and dignified as superior court judge. Horace didn’t want to
stay on the ranch all his life, and his wife had an urge to live in Salinas where she had relatives.
When the rumors, repeated by the Indian and the carpenters, that Adam Trask had been shot
reached Horace, he saddled up right away and left his wife to finish butchering the pig he had
killed that morning.
Just north of the big sycamore tree where the Hester road turns off to the left, Horace met Julius
Euskadi. Julius was trying to decide whether to go quail hunting or to King City and catch the
train to Salinas to shake some of the dust out of his britches. The Euskadis were well-to-do,
handsome people of Basque extraction.
Julius said, “If you’d come along with me, I’d go into Salinas. They tell me that right next door to
Jen-ny’s, two doors from the Long Green, there’s a new place called Faye’s. I heard it was pretty
nice, run like San Francisco. They’ve got a piano player.”
Horace rested his elbow on his saddle horn and stirred a fly from his horse’s shoulder with his
rawhide quirt. “Some other time,” he said. “I’ve got to look into something.”
“You wouldn’t be going to Trask’s, would you?”
“That’s right. Did you hear anything about it?”
“Not to make any sense. I heard Mr. Trask shot himself in the shoulder with a forty-four and then
fired everybody on the ranch. How do you go about shooting yourself in the shoulder with a fortyfour, Horace?”
“I don’t know. Them Easterners are pretty clever. I thought I’d go up and find out. Didn’t his
wife just have a baby?”
“Twins, I heard,” said Julius. “Maybe they shot him.”
“One hold the gun and the other pull the trigger? Hear anything else?”
“All mixed up, Horace. Want some company?”
“I’m not going to deputize you, Julius. Sheriff says the supervisors are raising hell about the
payroll. Hornby out in the Alisal deputized his great aunt and kept her in posse three weeks just
before Easter.”
“You’re fooling!”

“No, I’m not. And you get no star.”
“Hell, I don’t want to be a deputy. Just thought I’d ride along with you for company. I’m curious.”
“Me too. Glad to have you, Julius. I can always fling the oath around your neck if there’s any
trouble. What do you say the new place is called?”
“Faye’s. Sacramento woman.”
“They do things pretty nice in Sacramento,” and Horace told how they did things in Sacramento
as they rode along.
It was a nice day to be riding. As they turned into the Sanchez draw they were cursing the bad
hunting in recent years. Three things are never any good—farming, fishing, and hunting—
compared to other years, that is. Julius was saying, “Christ, I wish they hadn’t killed off all the
grizzly bears. In eighteen-eighty my grandfather killed one up by Pleyto weighed eighteen
hundred pounds.”
A silence came on them as they rode in under the oaks, a silence they took from the place itself.
There was no sound, no movement.
“I wonder if he finished fixing up the old house,” Horace said.
“Hell, no. Rabbit Holman was working on it, and he told me Trask called them all in and fired
them. Told them not to come back.”
“They say Trask has got a pot of money.”
“I guess he’s well fixed, all right,” said Julius. “Sam Hamilton is sinking four wells—if he didn’t
get fired too.”
“How is Mr. Hamilton? I ought to go up to see him.”
“He’s fine. Full of hell as ever.”
“I’ll have to go up and pay him a visit,” said Horace.
Lee came out on the stoop to meet them.
Horace said, “Hello, Ching Chong. Bossy man here?”
“He sick,” said Lee.
“I’d like to see him.”
“No see. He sick.”
“That’s enough of that,” said Horace. “Tell him Deputy Sheriff Quinn wants to see him.”
Lee disappeared, and in a moment he was back. “You come,” he said, “I take horsy.”
Adam lay in the four-poster bed where the twins had been born. He was propped high with
pillows, and a mound of home-devised bandages covered his left breast and shoulder. The room
reeked of Hall’s Cream Salve.
Horace said later to his wife, “And if you ever saw death still breathing, there it was.”
Adam’s cheeks hugged the bone and pulled the skin of his nose tight and slimy. His eyes seemed
to bulge out of his head and to take up the whole upper part of his face, and they were shiny with
sickness, intense and myopic. His bony right hand kneaded a fistful of cover-let.
Horace said, “Howdy, Mr. Trask. Heard you got hurt.” He paused, waiting for an answer. He
went on, “Just thought I’d drop around and see how you were doing. How’d it happen?”
A look of transparent eagerness came over Adam’s face. He shifted slightly in the bed.

“If it hurts to talk you can whisper,” Horace added helpfully.
“Only when I breathe deep,” Adam said softly. “I was cleaning my gun and it went off.”
Horace glanced at Julius and then back. Adam saw the look and a little color of embarrassment
rose in his cheeks.
“Happens all the time,” said Horace. “Got the gun around?”
“I think Lee put it away.”
Horace stepped to the door. “Hey there, Ching Chong, bring the pistol.”
In a moment Lee poked the gun butt-first through the door. Horace looked at it, swung the
cylinder out, poked the cartridges out, and smelled the empty brass cylinder of the one empty
shell. “There’s better shoot-ing cleaning the damn things than pointing them. I’ll have to make a
report to the county, Mr. Trask. I won’t take up much of your time. You were cleaning the barrel,
maybe with a rod, and the gun went off and hit you in the shoulder?”
“That’s right, sir,” Adam said quickly.
“And cleaning it, you hadn’t swung out the cylin-der?”
“That’s right.”
“And you were poking the rod in and out with the barrel pointed toward you with the hammer
cocked?”
Adam’s breath rasped in a quick intake.
Horace went on, “And it must have blowed the rod right through you and took off your left hand
too.” Horace’s pale sun-washed eyes never left Adam’s face. He said kindly, “What happened,
Mr. Trask? Tell me what happened.”
“I tell you truly it was an accident, sir.”
“Now you wouldn’t have me write a report like I just said. The sheriff would think I was crazy.
What hap-pened?”
“Well, I’m not very used to guns. Maybe it wasn’t just like that, but I was cleaning it and it went
off.”
There was a whistle in Horace’s nose. He had to breathe through his mouth to stop it. He moved
slowly up from the foot of the bed, nearer to Adam’s head and staring eyes. “You came from the
East not very long ago, didn’t you, Mr. Trask?”
“That’s right. Connecticut.”
“I guess people don’t use guns very much there any more.”
“Not much.”
“Little hunting?”
“Some.”
“So you’d be more used to a shotgun?”
“That’s right. But I never hunted much.”
“I guess you didn’t hardly use a pistol at all, so you didn’t know how to handle it.”
“That’s right,” Adam said eagerly. “Hardly anybody there has a pistol.”
“So when you came here you bought that forty-four because everybody out here has a pistol and
you were going to learn how to use it.”

“Well, I thought it might be a good thing to learn.”
Julius Euskadi stood tensely, his face and body re-ceptive, listening but uncommunicative.
Horace sighed and looked away from Adam. His eyes brushed over and past Julius and came
back to his hands. He laid the gun on the bureau and carefully lined the brass and lead cartridges
beside it. “You know,” he said, “I’ve only been a deputy a little while. I thought I was going to
have some fun with it and maybe in a few years run for sheriff. I haven’t got the guts for it. It
isn’t any fun to me.”
Adam watched him nervously.
“I don’t think anybody’s ever been afraid of me before—mad at me, yes—but not afraid. It’s a
mean thing, makes me feel mean.”
Julius said irritably, “Get to it. You can’t resign right this minute.”
“The hell I can’t—if I want to. All right! Mr. Trask, you served in the United States Cavalry. The
weapons of the cavalry are carbines and pistols. You—” He stopped and swallowed. “What
happened, Mr. Trask?”
Adam’s eyes seemed to grow larger, and they were moist and edged with red. “It was an
accident,” he whispered.
“Anybody see it? Was your wife with you when it happened?”
Adam did not reply, and Horace saw that his eyes were closed. “Mr. Trask,” he said, “I know
you’re a sick man. I’m trying to make it as easy on you as I can. Why don’t you rest now while I
have a talk with your wife?” He waited a moment and then turned to the doorway, where Lee still
stood. “Ching Chong, tell Missy I would admire to talk to her for a few minutes.”
Lee did not reply.
Adam spoke without opening his eyes. “My wife is away on a visit.”
“She wasn’t here when it happened?” Horace glanced at Julius and saw a curious expression on
Julius’s lips. The corners of his mouth were turned slightly up in a sardonic smile. Horace
thought quickly, He’s ahead of me. He’d make a good sheriff. “Say,” he said, “that’s kind of
interesting. Your wife had a baby—two babies—two weeks ago, and now she’s gone on a visit.
Did she take the babies with her? I thought I heard them a little while ago.” Horace leaned over
the bed and touched the back of Adam’s clenched right hand. “I hate this, but I can’t stop now.
Trask!” he said loudly, “I want you to tell me what happened. This isn’t nosiness. This is the law.
Now, damn it, you open your eyes and tell me or, by Christ, I’ll take you in to the sheriff even if
you are hurt.”
Adam opened his eyes, and they were blank like a sleepwalker’s eyes. And his voice came out
without rise or fall, without emphasis, and without any emo-tion. It was as though he pronounced
perfectly words in a language he did not understand.
“My wife went away,” he said.
“Where did she go?”
“I don’t know.”
“What do you mean?”
“I don’t know where she went.”

Julius broke in, speaking for the first time. “Why did she go?”
“I don’t know.”
Horace said angrily, “You watch it, Trask. You’re playing pretty close to the edge and I don’t like
what I’m thinking. You must know why she went away.”
“I don’t know why she went.”
“Was she sick? Did she act strange?”
“No.”
Horace turned. “Ching Chong, do you know any-thing about this?”
“I go King City Satdy. Come back mebbe twelve night. Find Missy Tlask on floor.”
“So you weren’t here when it happened?”
“No, ma’am.”
“All right, Trask, I’ll have to get back to you. Open up that shade a little, Ching Chong, so I can
see. There, that’s better. Now I’m going to do it your way first until I can’t any more. Your wife
went away. Did she shoot you?”
“It was an accident.”
“All right, an accident, but was the gun in her hand?”
“It was an accident.”
“You don’t make it very easy. But let’s say she went away and we have to find her—see?—like a
kid’s game. You’re making it that way. How long have you been married?”
“Nearly a year.”
“What was her name before you married her?”
There was a long pause, and then Adam said softly, “I won’t tell. I promised.”
“Now you watch it. Where did she come from?”
“I don’t know.”
“Mr. Trask, you’re talking yourself right into the county jail. Let’s have a description. How tall
was she?”
Adam’s eyes gleamed. “Not tall—little and delicate.”
“That’s just fine. What color hair? Eyes?”
“She was beautiful.”
“Was?”
“Is.”
“Any scars?”
“Oh, God, no. Yes—a scar on her forehead.”
“You don’t know her name, where she came from, where she went, and you can’t describe her.
And you think I’m a fool.”
Adam said, “She had a secret. I promised I wouldn’t ask her. She was afraid for someone.” And
without warning Adam began to cry. His whole body shook, and his breath made little high
sounds. It was hopeless crying.
Horace felt misery rising in him. “Come on in the other room, Julius,” he said and led the way
into the living room. “All right, Julius, tell me what you think. Is he crazy?”

“I don’t know.”
“Did he kill her?”
“That’s what jumped into my mind.”
“Mine too,” said Horace. “My God!” He hurried into the bedroom and came back with the pistol
and the shells. “I forgot them,” he apologized. “I won’t last long in this job.”
Julius asked, “What are you going to do?”
“Well, I think it’s beyond me. I told you I wouldn’t put you on the payroll, but hold up your right
hand.”
“I don’t want to get sworn in, Horace. I want to go to Salinas.”
“You don’t have any choice, Julius. I’ll have to arrest you if you don’t get your goddam hand up.”
Julius reluctantly put up his hand and disgustedly repeated the oath. “And that’s what I get for
keeping you company,” he said. “My father will skin me alive. All right, what do we do now?”
Horace said, “I’m going to run to papa. I need the sheriff. I’d take Trask in but I don’t want to
move him. You’ve got to stay, Julius. I’m sorry. Have you got a gun?”
“Hell, no.”
“Well, take this one, and take my star.” He unpinned it from his shirt and held it out.
“How long do you think you’ll be gone?”
“Not any longer than I can help. Did you ever see Mrs. Trask, Julius?”
“No, I didn’t.”
“Neither did I. And I’ve got to tell the sheriff that Trask doesn’t know her name or anything. And
she’s not very big and she is beautiful. That’s one hell of a description! I think I’ll resign before I
tell the sheriff, because he’s sure as hell going to fire me afterward. Do you think he killed her?”
“How the hell do I know?”
“Don’t get mad.”
Julius picked up the gun and put the cartridges back in the cylinder and balanced it in his hand.
“You want an idea, Horace?”
“Don’t it look like Ineed one?”
“Well, Sam Hamilton knew her—he took the babies, Rabbit says. And Mrs. Hamilton took care
of her. Why don’t you ride out there on your way and find out what she really looked like.”
“I think maybe you better keep that star,” said Horace. “That’s good. I’ll get going.”
“You want me to look around?”
“I want you just to see that he doesn’t get away—or hurt himself. Understand? Take care of
yourself.”

About midnight Horace got on a freight train in King City. He sat up in the cab with the engineer,
and he was in Salinas the first thing in the morning. Salinas was the county seat, and it was a fastgrowing town. Its population was due to cross the two thousand mark any time. It was the biggest
town between San Jose and San Luis Obispo, and everyone felt that a brilliant future was in store
for it.

Horace walked up from the Southern Pacific Depot and stopped in the Chop House for breakfast.
He didn’t want to get the sheriff out so early and rouse ill will when it wasn’t necessary. In the
Chop House he ran into young Will Hamilton, looking pretty prosper-ous in a salt-and-pepper
business suit.
Horace sat down at the table with him. “How are you, Will?”
“Oh, pretty good.”
“Up here on business?”
“Well, yes, I do have a little deal on.”
“You might let me in on something sometime.” Horace felt strange talking like this to such a
young man, but Will Hamilton had an aura of success about him. Everybody knew he was going
to be a very influ-ential man in the county. Some people exude their futures, good or bad.
“I’ll do that, Horace. I thought the ranch took all your time.”
“I could be persuaded to rent it if anything turned up.”
Will leaned over the table. “You know, Horace, our part of the county has been pretty much left
out. Did you ever think of running for office?”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, you’re a deputy—did you ever think of run-ning for sheriff?”
“Why, no, I didn’t.”
“Well, you think about it. Just keep it under your hat. I’ll look you up in a couple of weeks and
we’ll talk about it. But keep it under your hat.”
“I’ll certainly do that, Will. But we’ve got an awful good sheriff.”
“I know. That’s got nothing to do with it. King City hasn’t got a single county officer—you see?”
“I see. I’ll think about it. Oh, by the way, I stopped by and saw your father and mother yesterday.”
Will’s face lighted up. “You did? How were they?”
“Just fine. You know, your father is a real comical genius.”
Will chuckled. “He made us laugh all the time we were growing up.”
“But he’s a smart man too, Will. He showed me a new kind of windmill he’s invented—
goddamnedest thing you ever saw.”
“Oh, Lord,” said Will, “here come the patent attor-neys again!”
“But this is good,” said Horace.
“They’re all good. And the only people who make any money are the patent lawyers. Drives my
mother crazy.”
“I guess you’ve got a point there.”
Will said, “The only way to make any money is to sell something somebody else makes.”
“You’ve got a point there, Will, but this is the goddamnedest windmill you ever saw.”
“He took you in, did he, Horace?”
“I guess he did. But you wouldn’t want him to change, would you?”
“Oh, Lord, no!” said Will. “You think about what I said.”
“All right.”
“And keep it under your hat,” said Will.

The sheriff’s job was not an easy one, and that county which, out of the grab bag of popular
elections, pulled a good sheriff was lucky. It was a complicated position. The obvious duties of
the sheriff—enforcing the law and keeping the peace—were far from the most important ones. It
was true that the sheriff represented armed force in the county, but in a community seething with
individuals a harsh or stupid sheriff did not last long. There were water rights, boundary disputes,
astray arguments, domestic relations, paternity matters—all to be settled without force of arms.
Only when everything else failed did a good sheriff make an arrest. The best sheriff was not the
best fighter but the best diplomat. And Monterey County had a good one. He had a brilliant gift
for minding his own business.
Horace went into the sheriff’s office in the old county jail about ten minutes after nine. The
sheriff shook hands and discussed the weather and the crops until Horace was ready to get down
to business.
“Well, sir,” Horace said finally, “I had to come up to get your advice.” And he told his story in
great detail—what everybody had said and how they looked and what time it was—everything.
After a few moments the sheriff closed his eyes and laced his fingers together. He punctuated the
account occasionally by opening his eyes, but he made no com-ment.
“Well, there I was on a limb,” Horace said. “I couldn’t find out what happened. I couldn’t even
find out what the woman looked like. It was Julius Euskadi got the idea I should go to see Sam
Hamilton.”
The sheriff stirred, crossed his legs, and inspected the job. “You think he killed her.”
“Well, I did. But Mr. Hamilton kind of talked me out of it. He says Trask hasn’t got it in him to
kill anybody.”
“Everybody’s got it in him,” the sheriff said. “You just find his trigger and anybody will go off.”
“Mr. Hamilton told me some funny things about her. You know, when he was taking her babies
she bit him on the hand. You ought to see that hand, like a wolf got him.”
“Did Sam give you a description?”
“He did, and his wife did.” Horace took a piece of paper from his pocket and read a detailed
description of Cathy. Between the two of them the Hamiltons knew pretty much everything
physical there was to know about Cathy.
When Horace finished the sheriff sighed. “They both agreed about the scar?”
“Yes, they did. And both of them remarked about how sometimes it was darker than other times.”
The sheriff closed his eyes again and leaned back in his chair. Suddenly he straightened up,
opened a draw-er of his rolltop desk, and took out a pint of whisky. “Have a drink,” he said.
“Don’t mind if I do. Here’s looking at you.” Horace wiped his mouth and handed back the pint.
“Got any ideas?” he asked.
The sheriff took three big swallows of whisky, corked the pint, and put it back in the drawer
before he replied. “We’ve got a pretty well-run county,” he said. “I get along with the constables,
give them a hand when they need it, and they help me out when I need it. You take a town
growing like Salinas, and strangers in and out all the time—we could have trouble if we didn’t
watch it pretty close. My office gets along fine with the local people.” He looked Horace in the

eye. “Don’t get restless. I’m not making a speech. I just want to tell you how it is. We don’t drive
people. We’ve got to live with them.”
“Did I do something wrong?”
“No, you didn’t, Horace. You did just right. If you hadn’t come to town or if you had brought Mr.
Trask in, we’d of been in one hell of a mess. Now hold on. I’m going to tell you—”
“I’m listening,” said Horace.
“Over across the tracks down by Chinatown there’s a row of whorehouses.”
“I know that.”
“Everybody knows it. If we closed them up they’d just move. The people want those houses. We
keep an eye on them so not much bad happens. And the people that run those houses keep in
touch with us. I’ve picked up some wanted men from tips I got down there.”
Horace said, “Julius told me—”
“Now wait a minute. Let me get all this said so we won’t have to go back over it. About three
months ago a fine-looking woman came in to see me. She wanted to open a house here and
wanted to do it right. Came from Sacramento. Ran a place there. She had letters from some pretty
important people—straight record—never had any trouble. A pretty damn good citizen.”
“Julius told me. Name of Faye.”
“That’s right. Well, she opened a nice place, quiet, well run. It was about time old Jenny and the
Nigger had some competition. They were mad as hell about it, but I told them just what I told
you. It’s about time they had some competition.”
“There’s a piano player.”
“Yes, there is. Good one too—blind fella. Say, are you going to let me tell this?”
“I’m sorry,” said Horace.
“That’s all right. I know I’m slow but I’m thorough. Anyways, Faye turned out to be just what
she looks like, a good solid citizen. Now there’s one thing a good quiet whorehouse is more
scared of than anything else. Take a flighty randy girl runs off from home and goes in a house.
Her old man finds her and he begins to shovel up hell. Then the churches get into it, and the
women, and pretty soon that whorehouse has got a bad name and we’ve got to close it up. You
understand?”
“Yeah!” Horace said softly.
“Now don’t get ahead of me. I hate to tell something you already thought out. Faye sent me a
note Sunday night. She’s got a girl and she can’t make much out of her. What puzzles Faye is that
this kid looks like a runaway girl except she’s a goddam good whore. She knows all the answers
and all the tricks. I went down and looked her over. She told me the usual bull, but I can’t find a
thing wrong with her. She’s of age and nobody’s made a complaint.” He spread his hands. “Well,
there it is. What do we do about it?”
“You’re pretty sure it’s Mrs. Trask?”
The sheriff said, “Wide-set eyes, yellow hair, and a scar on her forehead, and she came in Sunday
after-noon.”
Adam’s weeping face was in Horace’s mind. “God all mighty! Sheriff, you got to get somebody

else to tell him. I’ll quit before I do.”
The sheriff gazed into space. “You say he didn’t even know her name, where she came from. She
really bull-shitted him, didn’t she?”
“The poor bastard,” Horace said. “The poor bastard is in love with her. No, by God, somebody
else has got to tell him. I won’t.”
The sheriff stood up. “Let’s go down to the Chop House and get a cup of coffee.”
They walked along the street in silence for a while. “Horace,” the sheriff said, “if I told some of
the things I know, this whole goddam county would go up in smoke.”
“I guess that’s right.”
“You said she had twins?”
“Yeah, twin boys.”
“You listen to me, Horace. There’s only three people in the world that knows—her and you and
me. I’m going to warn her that if she ever tells I’ll brush her ass out of this county so fast it’ll
burn. And, Horace—if you should ever get an itchy tongue, before you tell anybody, even your
wife, why, you think about those little boys finding out their mother is a whore.”

Adam sat in his chair under the big oak tree. His left arm was expertly bandaged against his side
so that he could not move his shoulder. Lee came out carrying the laundry basket. He set it on the
ground beside Adam and went back inside.
The twins were awake, and they both looked blindly and earnestly up at the wind-moved leaves
of the oak tree. A dry oak leaf came whirling down and landed in the basket. Adam leaned over
and picked it out.
He didn’t hear Samuel’s horse until it was almost upon him, but Lee had seen him coming. He
brought a chair out and led Doxology away toward the shed.
Samuel sat down quietly, and he didn’t trouble Adam by looking at him too much, and he didn’t
trouble him by not looking at him. The wind freshened in the treetops and a fringe of it ruffled
Samuel’s hair. “I thought I’d better get back to the wells,” Samuel said softly.
Adam’s voice had gone rusty from lack of use. “No,” he said, “I don’t want any wells. I’ll pay for
the work you did.”
Samuel leaned over the basket and put his finger against the small palm of one of the twins and
the fingers closed and held on. “I guess the last bad habit a man will give up is advising.”
“I don’t want advice.”
“Nobody does. It’s a giver’s present. Go through the motions, Adam.”
“What motions?”
“Act out being alive, like a play. And after a while, a long while, it will be true.”
“Why should I?” Adam asked.
Samuel was looking at the twins. “You’re going to pass something down no matter what you do
or if you do nothing. Even if you let yourself go fallow, the weeds will grow and the brambles.
Something will grow.”

Adam did not answer, and Samuel stood up. “I’ll be back,” he said. “I’ll be back again and again.
Go through the motions, Adam.”
In the back of the shed Lee held Doxology while Sam mounted. “There goes your bookstore,
Lee,” he said.
“Oh, well,” said the Chinese, “maybe I didn’t want it much anyway.”

Chapter 19
1
A new country seems to follow a pattern. First come the openers, strong and brave and rather
childlike. They can take care of themselves in a wilderness, but they are naïve and helpless
against men, and perhaps that is why they went out in the first place. When the rough edges are
worn off the new land, businessmen and lawyers come in to help with the development—to solve
problems of ownership, usually by removing the temptations to themselves. And finally comes
culture, which is entertainment, relaxation, transport out of the pain of living. And culture can be
on any level, and is.
The church and the whorehouse arrived in the Far West simultaneously. And each would have
been hor-rified to think it was a different facet of the same thing. But surely they were both
intended to accomplish the same thing: the singing, the devotion, the poetry of the churches took
a man out of his bleakness for a time, and so did the brothels. The sectarian churches came in
swinging, cocky and loud and confident. Ignoring the laws of debt and repayment, they built
churches which couldn’t be paid for in a hundred years. The sects fought evil, true enough, but
they also fought each other with a fine lustiness. They fought at the turn of a doctrine. Each
happily believed all the others were bound for hell in a basket. And each for all its bumptiousness brought with it the same thing: the Scripture on which our ethics, our art and poetry,
and our rela-tionships are built. It took a smart man to know where the difference lay between the
sects, but anyone could see what they had in common. And they brought mu-sic—maybe not the
best, but the form and sense of it. And they brought conscience, or, rather, nudged the dozing
conscience. They were not pure, but they had a potential of purity, like a soiled white shirt. And
any man could make something pretty fine of it within himself. True enough, the Reverend
Billing, when they caught up with him, turned out to be a thief, an adul-terer, a libertine, and a
zoophilist, but that didn’t change the fact that he had communicated some good things to a great
number of receptive people. Billing went to jail, but no one ever arrested the good things he had
released. And it doesn’t matter much that his mo-tive was impure. He used good material and
some of it stuck. I use Billing only as an outrageous example. The honest preachers had energy
and go. They fought the devil, no holds barred, boots and eye-gouging per-mitted. You might get
the idea that they howled truth and beauty the way a seal bites out the National An-them on a row
of circus horns. But some of the truth and beauty remained, and the anthem was recogniza-ble.
The sects did more than this, though. They built the structure of social life in the Salinas Valley.
The church supper is the grandfather of the country club, just as the Thursday poetry reading in
the basement under the vestry sired the little theater.
While the churches, bringing the sweet smell of piety for the soul, came in prancing and farting

like brewery horses in bock-beer time, the sister evangelism, with release and joy for the body,
crept in silently and gravely, with its head bowed and its face covered.
You may have seen the spangled palaces of sin and fancy dancing in the false West of the
movies, and maybe some of them existed—but not in the Salinas Valley. The brothels were quiet,
orderly, and circum-spect. Indeed, if after hearing the ecstatic shrieks of climactic conversion
against the thumping beat of the melodeon you had stood under the window of a whore-house
and listened to the low decorous voices, you would have been likely to confuse the identities of
the two ministries. The brothel was accepted while it was not admitted.
I will tell you about the solemn courts of love in Salinas. They were about the same in other
towns, but the Salinas Row has a pertinence to this telling.
You walked west on Main Street until it bent. That’s where Castroville Street crossed Main.
Castroville Street is now called Market Street, God knows why. Streets used to be named for the
place they aimed at. Thus Castroville Street, if you followed it nine miles, brought you to
Castroville, Alisal Street to Alisal, and so forth.
Anyway, when you came to Castroville Street you turned right. Two blocks down, the Southern
Pacific tracks cut diagonally across the street on their way south, and a street crossed Castroville
Street from east to west. And for the life of me I cannot remember the name of that street. If you
turned left on that street and crossed the tracks you were in Chinatown. If you turned right you
were on the Row.
It was a black ’dobe street, deep shining mud in winter and hard as rutted iron in summer. In the
spring the tall grass grew along its sides—wild oats and mal-low weeds and yellow mustard
mixed in. In the early morning the sparrows shrieked over the horse manure in the street.
Do you remember hearing that, old men? And do you remember how an easterly breeze brought
odors in from Chinatown, roasting pork and punk and black tobacco and yen shi? And do you
remember the deep Waiting stroke of the great gong in the Joss House, and how its tone hung in
the air so long?
Remember, too, the little houses, unpainted, unre-paired? They seemed very small, and they tried
to efface themselves in outside neglect, and the wild over-grown front yards tried to hide them
from the street. Remember how the shades were always drawn with little lines of yellow light
around their edges? You could hear only a murmur from within. Then the front door would open
to admit a country boy, and you’d hear laughter and perhaps the soft sentimental tone of an openface piano with a piece of toilet chain across the strings, and then the door would close it off
again.
Then you might hear horses’ hoofs on the dirt street, and Pet Bulene would drive his hack up in
front, and maybe four or five portly men would get out—great men, rich or official, bankers
maybe, or the court-house gang. And Pet would drive around the corner and settle down in his
hack to wait for them. Big cats would ripple across the street to disappear in the tall grass.
And then—remember?—the train whistle and the boring light and a freight from King City
would go stomping across Castroville Street and into Salinas and you could hear it sighing at the
station. Remember?

Every town has its celebrated madams, eternal wom-en to be sentimentalized down the years.
There is some-thing very attractive to men about a madam. She com-bines the brains of a
businessman, the toughness of a prize fighter, the warmth of a companion, the humor of a
tragedian. Myths collect around her, and, oddly enough, not voluptuous myths. The stories
remembered and repeated about a madam cover every field but the bedroom. Remembering, her
old customers picture her as a philanthropist, medical authority, bouncer, and poetess of the
bodily emotions without being involved with them.
For a number of years Salinas had sheltered two of these treasures: Jenny, sometimes called
Fartin’ Jenny, and the Nigger, who owned and operated the Long Green. Jenny was a good
companion, a keeper of secrets, a giver of secret loans. There is a whole litera-ture of stories
about Jenny in Salinas.
The Nigger was a handsome, austere woman with snow-white hair and a dark and awful dignity.
Her brown eyes, brooding deep in her skull, looked out on an ugly world with philosophic
sorrow. She conducted her house like a cathedral dedicated to a sad but erect Priapus. If you
wanted a good laugh and a poke in the ribs, you went to Jenny’s and got your money’s worth; but
if the sweet world-sadness close to tears crept out of your immutable loneliness, the Long Green
was your place. When you came out of there you felt that some-thing pretty stern and important
had happened. It was no jump in the hay. The dark beautiful eyes of the Nigger stayed with you
for days.
When Faye came down from Sacramento and opened her house there was a flurry of animosity
from the two incumbents. They got together to drive Faye out, but they discovered she was not in
competition.
Faye was the motherly type, big-breasted, big-hipped, and warm. She was a bosom to cry on, a
soother and a stroker. The iron sex of the Nigger and the tavern bacchanalianism of Jenny had
their devo-tees, and they were not lost to Faye. Her house became the refuge of young men
puling in puberty, mourning over lost virtue, and aching to lose some more. Faye was the
reassurer of misbegotten husbands. Her house took up the slack for frigid wives. It was the
cinnamon-scented kitchen of one’s grandmother. If any sexual thing happened to you at Faye’s
you felt it was an accident but forgivable. Her house led the youths of Salinas into the thorny path
of sex in the pinkest, smoothest way. Faye was a nice woman, not very bright, highly moral, and
easily shocked. People trusted her and she trusted everyone. No one could want to hurt Faye once
he knew her. She was no competition to the others. She was a third phase.
Just as in a store or on a ranch the employees are images of the boss, so in a whorehouse the girls
are very like the madam, partly because she hires that kind and partly because a good madam
imprints her person-ality on the business. You could stay a very long time at Faye’s before you
would hear an ugly or suggestive word spoken. The wanderings to the bedrooms, the payments,
were so soft and casual they seemed inciden-tal. All in all, she ran a hell of a fine house, as the
constable and the sheriff knew. Faye contributed heavi-ly to every charity. Having a revulsion
against disease, she paid for regular inspection of her girls. You had less chance of contracting a
difficulty at Faye’s than with your Sunday School teacher. Faye soon became a solid and

desirable citizen of the growing town of Salinas.

2
The girl Kate puzzled Faye—she was so young and pretty, so lady-like, so well educated. Faye
took her into her own inviolate bedroom and questioned her far more than she would if Kate had
been another kind of girl. There were always women knocking on the door of a whorehouse, and
Faye recognized most of them instantly. She could tick them off—lazy, vengeful, lust-ful,
unsatisfied, greedy, ambitious. Kate didn’t fall into any of these classes.
“I hope you don’t mind my asking you all these questions,” she said. “It just seems so strange
that you should come here. Why, you could get a husband and a surrey and a corner house in
town with no trouble at all, no trouble at all.” And Faye rolled her wedding band around and
around on her fat little finger.
Kate smiled shyly. “It’s so hard to explain. I hope you won’t insist on knowing. The happiness of
someone very near and dear to me is involved. Please don’t ask me.”
Faye nodded solemnly. “I’ve known things like that. I had one girl who was supporting her baby,
and no one knew for a long, long time. That girl has a fine house and a husband in—there, I
nearly told you where. I’d cut out my tongue before I’d tell. Do you have a baby, dear?”
Kate looked down to try to conceal the shine of tears in her eyes. When she could control her
throat she whispered, “I’m sorry, I can’t talk about it.”
“That’s all right. That’s all right. You just take your time.”
Faye was not bright, but she was far from stupid. She went to the sheriff and got herself cleared.
There was no sense in taking chances. She knew something was wrong about Kate, but if it didn’t
harm the house it really wasn’t Faye’s business.
Kate might have been a chiseler, but she wasn’t. She went to work right away. And when
customers come back again and again and ask for a girl by name, you know you’ve got
something. A pretty face won’t do that. It was quite apparent to Faye that Kate was not learning a
new trade.
There are two things it is good to know about a new girl: first, will she work? and second, will
she get along with the other girls? There’s nothing will upset a house like an ill-tempered girl.
Faye didn’t have long to wonder about the second question. Kate put herself out to be pleasant.
She helped the other girls keep their rooms clean. She served them when they were sick, listened
to their troubles, answered them in matters of love, and as soon as she had some, loaned them
money. You couldn’t want a better girl. She became best friend to everyone in the house.
There was no trouble Kate would not take, no drudgery she was afraid of, and, in addition, she
brought business. She soon had her own group of regu-lar customers. Kate was thoughtful too.
She remem-bered birthdays and always had a present and a cake with candles. Faye realized she
had a treasure.
People who don’t know think it is easy to be a madam—just sit in a big chair and drink beer and
take half the money the girls make, they think. But it’s not like that at all. You have to feed the
girls—that’s groceries and a cook. Your laundry problem is quite a bit more complicated than

that of a hotel. You have to keep the girls well and as happy as possible, and some of them can
get pretty ornery. You have to keep suicide at an absolute minimum, and whores, particularly the
ones getting along in years, are flighty with a razor; and that gets your house a bad name.
It isn’t so easy, and if you have waste too you can lose money. When Kate offered to help with
the mar-keting and planning of meals Faye was pleased, al-though she didn’t know when the girl
found time. Well, not only did the food improve, but the grocery bills came down one-third the
first month Kate took over. And the laundry—Faye didn’t know what Kate said to the man but
that bill suddenly dropped twenty-five per cent. Faye didn’t see how she ever got along without
Kate.
In the late afternoon before business they sat together in Faye’s room and drank tea. It was much
nicer since Kate had painted the woodwork and put up lace cur-tains. The girls began to realize
that there were two bosses, not one, and they were glad because Kate was very easy to get along
with. She made them turn more tricks but she wasn’t mean about it. They’d as likely as not have
a big laugh over it.
By the time a year had passed Faye and Kate were like mother and daughter. And the girls said,
“You watch—she’ll own this house some day.”
Kate’s hands were always busy, mostly at drawn worn on the sheerest of lawn handkerchiefs. She
could make beautiful initials. Nearly all the girls carried and treasured her handkerchiefs.
Gradually a perfectly natural thing happened. Faye, the essence of motherness, began to think of
Kate as her daughter. She felt this in her breast and in her emotions, and her natural morality took
hold. She did not want her daughter to be a whore. It was a perfectly reasonable sequence.
Faye thought hard how she was going to bring up the subject. It was a problem. It was Faye’s
nature to approach any subject sideways. She could not say, “I want you to give up whoring.”
She said, “If it is a secret, don’t answer, but I’ve always meant to ask you. What did the sheriff
say to you—good Lord, is it a year ago? How the time goes! Quicker as you get older, I think. He
was nearly an hour with you. He didn’t—but of course not. He’s a family man. He goes to
Jenny’s. But I don’t want to pry into your affairs.”
“There’s no secret at all about that,” said Kate. “I would have told you. He told me I should go
home. He was very nice about it. When I explained that I couldn’t, he was very nice and
understanding.”
“Did you tell him why?” Faye asked jealously.
“Of course not. Do you think I would tell him when I won’t tell you? Don’t be silly, darling.
You’re such a funny little girl.”
Faye smiled and snuggled contentedly down in her chair.
Kate’s face was in repose, but she was remembering every word of that interview. As a matter of
fact, she rather liked the sheriff. He was direct.

He had closed the door of her room, glanced around with the quick recording eye of a good
policeman—no photographs, none of the personal articles which identi-fy, nothing but clothes

and shoes.
He sat down on her little cane rocking chair and his buttocks hung over on each side. His fingers
got togeth-er in conference, talking to one another like ants. He spoke in an unemotional tone,
almost as though he weren’t much interested in what he was saying. Maybe that was what
impressed her.
At first she put on her slightly stupid demure look, but after a few of his words she gave that up
and bored into him with her eyes, trying to read his thoughts. He neither looked in her eyes nor
avoided them. But she was aware that he was inspecting her as she inspected him. She felt his
glance go over the scar on her fore-head almost as though he had touched it.
“I don’t want to make a record,” he said quietly. “I’ve held office a long time. About one more
term will be enough. You know, young woman, if this were fifteen years back I’d do some
checking, and I guess I’d find something pretty nasty.” He waited for some reac-tion from her but
she did not protest. He nodded his head slowly. “I don’t want to know,” he said. “I want peace in
this county, and I mean all kinds of peace, and that means people getting to sleep at night. Now I
haven’t met your husband,” he said, and she knew he noticed the slight movement of her
tightening muscles. “I hear he’s a very nice man. I hear also that he’s pretty hard hit.” He looked
into her eyes for a moment. “Don’t you want to know how bad you shot him?”
“Yes,” she said.
“Well, he’s going to get well—smashed his shoulder, but he’s going to get well. That Chink is
taking pretty good care of him. Course I don’t think he’ll lift any-thing with his left arm for quite
a spell. A forty-four tears hell out of a man. If the Chink hadn’t come back he’d of bled to death,
and you’d be staying with me in the jail.”
Kate was holding her breath, listening for any hint of what was coming and not hearing any hints.
“I’m sorry,” she said quietly.
The sheriff’s eyes became alert. “Now that’s the first time you’ve made a mistake,” he said.
“You’re not sorry. I knew somebody like you once—hung him twelve years ago in front of the
county jail. We used to do that here.”
The little room with its dark mahogany bed, its marble-top wash stand with bowl and pitcher and
a door for the pot, its wallpaper endlessly repeating little roses—little roses—the little room was
silent, the sound sucked out of it.
The sheriff was staring at a picture of three cher-ubim—just heads, curly-haired, limpid-eyed,
with wings about the size of pigeons’ wings growing out of where their necks would be. He
frowned. “That’s a funny picture for a whorehouse,” he said.
“It was here,” said Kate. Apparently the prelimi-naries were over now.
The sheriff straightened up, undid his fingers, and held the arms of his chair. Even his buttocks
pulled in a little. “You left a couple of babies,” he said. “Little boys. Now you calm down. I’m
not going to try to get you to go back. I guess I’d do quite a bit to keep you from going back. I
think I know you. I could just run you over the county line and have the next sheriff run you, and
that could keep up till you landed splash in the Atlantic Ocean. But I don’t want to do that. I
don’t care how you live as long as you don’t give me any trouble. A whore is a whore.”

Kate asked evenly, “What is it you do want?”
“That’s more like it,” the sheriff said. “Here’s what I want. I notice you changed your name. I
want you to keep your new name. I guess you made up someplace you came from—well, that’s
where you came from. And your reason—that’s when you’re maybe drunk—you keep your
reason about two thousand miles away from King City.”
She was smiling a little, and not a forced smile. She was beginning to trust this man and to like
him.
“One thing I thought of,” he said. “Did you know many people around King City?”
“No.”
“I heard about the knitting needle,” he said casually. “Well, it could happen that somebody you
knew might come in here. That your real hair color?”
“Yes.”
“Dye it black for a while. Lots of people look like somebody else.”
“How about this?” She touched her scar with a slender finger.
“Well, that’s just a—what is that word? What is that goddam word? I had it this morning.”
“Coincidence?”
“That’s it—coincidence.” He seemed to be finished. He got out tobacco and papers and rolled a
clumsy, lumpy cigarette. He broke out a sulphur match and struck it on the block and held it
away until its acrid blue flame turned yellow. His cigarette burned crooked-ly up the side.
Kate said, “Isn’t there a threat? I mean, what you’ll do if I—”
“No, there isn’t. I guess I could think up something pretty ornery, though, if it came to that. No, I
don’t want you—what you are, what you do, or what you say—to hurt Mr. Trask or his boys.
You figure you died and now you’re somebody else and we’ll get along fine.”
He stood up and went to the door, then turned. “I’ve got a boy—he’ll be twenty this year; big,
nice-looking fellow with a broken nose. Everybody likes him. I don’t want him in here. I’ll tell
Faye too. Let him go to Jenny’s. If he comes in, you tell him to go to Jenny’s.” He closed the
door behind him.
Kate smiled down at her fingers.

Faye twisted around in her chair to reach a piece of brown panocha studded with walnuts. When
she spoke it was around a mouth full of candy. Kate wondered uneasily whether she could read
minds, for Faye said, “I still don’t like it as well. I said it then and I say it again. I liked your hair
blond better. I don’t know what got into you to change it. You’ve got a fair complex-ion.”
Kate caught a single thread of hair with fingernails of thumb and forefinger and gently drew it
out. She was very clever. She told the best lie of all—the truth. “I didn’t want to tell you,” she
said. “I was afraid I might be recognized and that would hurt someone.”
Faye got up out of her chair and went to Kate and kissed her. “What a good child it is,” she said.
“What a thoughtful dear.”
Kate said, “Let’s have some tea. I’ll bring it in.” She went out of the room, and in the hall on the

way to the kitchen she rubbed the kiss from her cheek with her fingertips.
Back in her chair, Faye picked out a piece of pano-cha with a whole walnut showing through. She
put it in her mouth and bit into a piece of walnut shell. The sharp, pointed fragment hit a hollow
tooth and whanged into the nerve. Blue lights of pain flashed through her. Her forehead became
wet. When Kate came back with teapot and cups on a tray Faye was clawing at her mouth with a
crooked finger and whim-pering in agony.
“What is it?” Kate cried.
“Tooth—nutshell.”
“Here, let me see. Open and point.” Kate looked into the open mouth, then went to the nut bowl
on the fringed table for a nut pick. In a fraction of a second she had dug out the shell and held it
in the palm of her hand. “There it is.”
The nerve stopped shrieking and the pain dropped to an ache. “Only that big? It felt like a house.
Look, dear,” said Faye, “open that second drawer where my medicine is. Bring the paregoric and
a piece of cotton. Will you help me pack this tooth?”
Kate brought the bottle and pushed a little ball of saturated cotton into the tooth with the point of
the nut pick. “You ought to have it out.”
“I know. I will.”
“I have three teeth missing on this side.”
“Well, you’d never know it. That made me feel all shaky. Bring me the Pinkham, will you?” She
poured herself a slug of the vegetable compound and sighed with relief. “That’s a wonderful
medicine,” she said. “The woman who invented it was a saint.”

Chapter 20
1
It was a pleasant afternoon. Frémont’s Peak was light-ed pinkly by the setting sun, and Faye
could see it from her window. From over on Castroville Street came the sweet sound of jingling
horse bells from an eight-horse grain team down from the ridge. The cook was fighting pots in
the kitchen. There was a rubbing sound on the wall and then a gentle tap on the door.
“Come in, Cotton Eye,” Faye called.
The door opened and the crooked little cotton-eyed piano player stood in the entrance, waiting for
a sound to tell him where she was.
“What is it you want?” Faye asked.
He turned to her. “I don’t feel good, Miss Faye. I want to crawl into my bed and not do no
playing tonight.”
“You were sick two nights last week, Cotton Eye. Don’t you like your job?”
“I don’t feel good.”
“Well, all right. But I wish you’d take better care of yourself.”
Kate said softly, “Let the gong alone for a couple of weeks, Cotton Eye.”
“Oh, Miss Kate. I didn’t know you was here. I ain’t been smoking.”
“You’ve been smoking,” Kate said.
“Yes, Miss Kate, I sure will let it alone. I don’t feel good.” He closed the door, and they could
hear his hand rubbing along the wall to guide him.
Faye said, “He told me he’d stopped.”
“He hasn’t stopped.”
“The poor thing,” said Faye, “he doesn’t have much to live for.”
Kate stood in front of her. “You’re so sweet,” she said. “You believe in everybody. Someday if
you don’t watch, or I don’t watch for you, someone will steal the roof.”
“Who’d want to steal from me?” asked Faye.
Kate put her hand on Faye’s plump shoulders. “Not everyone is as nice as you are.”
Faye’s eyes glistened with tears. She picked up a handkerchief from the chair beside her and
wiped her eyes and patted delicately at her nostrils. “You’re like my own daughter, Kate,” she
said.
“I’m beginning to believe I am. I never knew my mother. She died when I was small.”
Faye drew a deep breath and plunged into the sub-ject.
“Kate, I don’t like you working here.”
“Why not?”
Faye shook her head, trying to find words. “I’m not ashamed. I run a nice house. If I didn’t

somebody else might run a bad house. I don’t do anybody any harm. I’m not ashamed.”
“Why should you be?” asked Kate.
“But I don’t like you working. I just don’t like it. You’re sort of my daughter. I don’t like my
daughter working.”
“Don’t be a silly, darling,” said Kate. “I have to—here or somewhere else. I told you. I have to
have the money.”
“No, you don’t.”
“Of course I do. Where else could I get it?”
“You could be my daughter. You could manage the house. You could take care of things for me
and not go upstairs. I’m not always well, you know.”
“I know you’re not, poor darling. But I have to have money.”
“There’s plenty for both of us, Kate. I could give you as much as you make and more, and you’d
be worth it.”
Kate shook her head sadly. “I do love you,” she said. “And I wish I could do what you want. But
you need your little reserve, and I—well, suppose some-thing should happen to you? No, I must
go on work-ing. Do you know, dear, I have five regulars tonight?”
A jar of shock struck Faye. “I don’t want you to work.”
“I have to, Mother.”
The word did it. Faye burst into tears, and Kate sat on the arm of her chair and stroked her cheek
and wiped her streaming eyes. The outburst sniffled to a close.
The dusk was settling deeply on the valley. Kate’s face was a glow of lightness under her dark
hair. “Now you’re all right. I’ll go and look in on the kitchen and then dress.”
“Kate, can’t you tell your regulars you’re sick?”
“Of course not, Mother.”
“Kate, it’s Wednesday. Probably won’t be anybody in after one o’clock.”
“The Woodmen of the World are having a do.”
“Oh, yes. But on Wednesday—the Woodmen won’t be here after two.”
“What are you getting at?”
“Kate, when you close, you tap on my door. I’ll have a little surprise for you.”
“What kind of a surprise?”
“Oh, a secret surprise! Will you ask the cook to come in as you go by the kitchen?”
“Sounds like a cake surprise.”
“Now don’t ask questions, darling. It’s a surprise.”
Kate kissed her. “What a dear you are, Mother.”
When she had closed the door behind her Kate stood for a moment in the hall. Her fingers
caressed her little pointed chin. Her eyes were calm. Then she stretched her arms over her head
and strained her body in a luxurious yawn. She ran her hands slowly down her sides from right
under her breasts to her hips. Her mouth corners turned up a little, and she moved toward the
kitchen.

The few regulars drifted in and out and two drummers walked down the Line to look them over,
but not a single Woodman of the World showed up. The girls sat yawning in the parlor until two
o’clock, waiting.
What kept the Woodmen away was a sad accident. Clarence Monteith had a heart attack right in
the mid-dle of the closing ritual and before supper. They laid him out on the carpet and dampened
his forehead until the doctor came. Nobody felt like sitting down to the doughnut supper. After
Dr. Wilde had arrived and looked Clarence over, the Woodmen made a stretcher by putting
flagpoles through the sleeves of two over-coats. On the way home Clarence died, and they had to
go for Dr. Wilde again. And by the time they had made plans for the funeral and written the piece
for the Salinas Journal, nobody had any heart for a whore-house.
The next day, when they found out what had hap-pened, the girls all remembered what Ethel had
said at ten minutes to two.
“My God!” Ethel had said. “I never heard it so quiet. No music, cat’s got Kate’s tongue. It’s like
setting up with a corpse.”
Later Ethel was impressed with having said it—almost as if she knew.
Grace had said, “I wonder what cat’s got Kate’s tongue. Don’t you feel good? Kate—I said, don’t
you feel good?”
Kate started. “Oh! I guess I was thinking of some-thing.”
“Well, I’m not,” said Grace. “I’m sleepy. Why don’t we close up? Let’s ask Faye if we can’t lock
up. There won’t even be a Chink in tonight. I’m going to ask Faye.”
Kate’s voice cut in on her. “Let Faye alone. She’s not well. We’ll close up at two.”
“That clock’s way wrong,” said Ethel. “What’s the matter with Faye?”
Kate said, “Maybe that’s what I was thinking about. Faye’s not well. I’m worried to death about
her. She won’t show it if she can help it.”
“I thought she was all right,” Grace said.
Ethel hit the jackpot again. “Well, she don’t look good to me. She’s got a kind of flush. I noticed
it.”
Kate spoke very softly. “Don’t you girls ever let her know I told you. She wouldn’t want you to
worry. What a dear she is!”
“Best goddam house I ever hustled,” said Grace.
Alice said, “You better not let her hear you talk words like that.”
“Balls!” said Grace. “She knows all the words.”
“She don’t like to hear them—not from us.”
Kate said patiently, “I want to tell you what hap-pened. I was having tea with her late this
afternoon and she fainted dead away. I do wish she’d see a doctor.”
“I noticed she had a kind of bright flush,” Ethel repeated. “That clock’s way wrong but I forget
which way.”
Kate said, “You girls go on to bed. I’ll lock up.”
When they were gone Kate went to her room and put on her pretty new print dress that made her
look like a little girl. She brushed and braided her hair and let it hang behind in one thick pigtail

tied with a little white bow. She patted her cheeks with Florida water. For a moment she
hesitated, and then from the top bureau drawer she took a little gold watch that hung from a fleurde-lis pin. She wrapped it in one of her fine lawn handkerchiefs and went out of the room.
The hall was very dark, but a rim of light showed under Faye’s door. Kate tapped softly.
Faye called, “Who is it?”
“It’s Kate.”
“Don’t you come in yet. You wait outside. I’ll tell you when.” Kate heard a rustling and a
scratching in the room. Then Faye called, “All right. Come in.”
The room was decorated. Japanese lanterns with candles in them hung on bamboo sticks at the
corners, and red crepe paper twisted in scallops from the center to the corners to give the effect of
a tent. On the table, with candlesticks around it, was a big white cake and a box of chocolates,
and beside these a basket with a magnum of champagne peeking out of crushed ice. Faye wore
her best lace dress and her eyes were shiny with emotion.
“What in the world?” Kate cried. She closed the door. “Why, it looks like a party!”
“It is a party. It’s a party for my dear daughter.”
“It’s not my birthday.” Faye said, “In a way maybe it is.”
“I don’t know what you mean. But I brought you a present.” She laid the folded handkerchief in
Faye’s lap. “Open it carefully,” she said.
Faye held the watch up. “Oh, my dear, my dear! You crazy child! No, I can’t take it.” She opened
the face and then picked open the back with her fingernail. It was engraved.—”To C. with all my
heart from A.”
“It was my mother’s watch,” Kate said softly. “I would like my new mother to have it.”
“My darling child! My darling child!”
“Mother would be glad.”
“But it’s my party. I have a present for my dear daughter—but I’ll have to do it in my own way.
Now, Kate, you open the bottle of wine and pour two glasses while I cut the cake. I want it to be
fancy.”
When everything was ready Faye took her seat be-hind the table. She raised her glass. “To my
new daughter—may you have long life and happiness.” And when they had drunk Kate proposed,
“To my mother.” Faye said, “You’ll make me cry—don’t make me cry. Over on the bureau, dear.
Bring the little ma-hogany box. There that’s the one. Now put it on the table here and open it.”
In the polished box lay a rolled white paper tied with a red ribbon. “What in the world is it?” Kate
asked. “It’s my gift to you. Open it.”
Kate very carefully untied the red ribbon and un-rolled the tube. It was written elegantly with
shaded letters, and it was well and carefully drawn and wit-nessed by the cook.
“All my worldly goods without exception to Kate Albey because I regard her as my daughter.”
It was simple, direct, and legally irreproachable. Kate read it three times, looked back at the date,
studied the cook’s signature. Faye watched her, and her lips were parted in expectation. When
Kate’s lips moved, reading, Faye’s lips moved.
Kate rolled the paper and tied the ribbon around it and put it in the box and closed the lid. She sat

in her chair.
Faye said at last, “Are you pleased?”
Kate’s eyes seemed to peer into and beyond Faye’s eyes—to penetrate the brain behind the eyes.
Kate said quietly, “I’m trying to hold on, Mother. I didn’t know anyone could be so good. I’m
afraid if I say anything too quickly or come too close to you, I’ll break to pieces.”
It was more dramatic than Faye had anticipated, quiet and electric. Faye said, “It’s a funny
present, isn’t it?”
“Funny? No, it isn’t funny.”
“I mean, a will is a strange present. But it means more than that. Now you are my real daughter I
can tell you. I—no, we—have cash and securities in excess of sixty thousand dollars. In my desk
are notations of accounts and safe-deposit boxes. I sold the place in Sacramento for a very good
price. Why are you so silent, child? Is something bothering you?”
“A will sounds like death. That’s thrown a pall.”
“But everyone should make a will.”
“I know, Mother.” Kate smiled ruefully. “A thought crossed my mind. I thought of all your kin
coming in angrily to break such a will as this. You can’t do this.”
“My poor little girl, is that what’s bothering you? I have no folks. As far as I know I have no kin.
And if I did have some—who would know? Do you think you are the only one with secrets? Do
you think I use the name I was born with?”
Kate looked long and levelly at Faye.
“Kate,” she cried, “Kate, it’s a party. Don’t be sad! Don’t be frozen!”
Kate got up, gently pulled the table aside, and sat down on the floor. She put her cheek on Faye’s
knee. Her slender fingers traced a gold thread on the skirt through its intricate leaf pattern. And
Faye stroked Kate’s cheek and hair and touched her strange ears. Shyly Faye’s fingers explored
to the borders of the scar.
“I think I’ve never been so happy before,” said Kate.
“My darling. You make me happy too. Happier than I have ever been. Now I don’t feel alone.
Now I feel safe.”
Kate picked delicately at the gold thread with her fingernails.
They sat in the warmth for a long time before Faye stirred. “Kate,” she said, “we’re forgetting.
It’s a party. We’ve forgotten the wine. Pour it, child. We’ll have a little celebration.”
Kate said uneasily, “Do we need it, Mother?”
“It’s good. Why not? I like to take on a little load. It lets the poison out. Don’t you like
champagne, Kate?”
“Well, I never have drunk much, it’s not good for me.”
“Nonsense. Pour it, darling.”
Kate got up from the floor and filled the glasses.
Faye said, “Now drink it down. I’m watching you. You’re not going to let an old woman get silly
by herself.”
“You’re not an old woman, Mother.”

“Don’t talk—drink it. I won’t touch mine until yours is empty.” She held her glass until Kate had
emptied hers, then gulped it. “Good, that’s good,” she said. “Fill them up. Now, come on dear—
down the rat hole. After two or three the bad things go away.”
Kate’s chemistry screamed against the wine. She remembered, and she was afraid.
Faye said, “Now let me see the bottom, child—there. You see how good it is? Fill up again.”
The transition came to Kate almost immediately after the second glass. Her fear evaporated, her
fear of any-thing disappeared. This was what she had been afraid of, and now it was too late. The
wine had forced a passage through all the carefully built barriers and de-fenses and deceptions,
and she didn’t care. The thing she had learned to cover and control was lost. Her voice became
chill and her mouth was thin. Her wide-set eyes slitted and grew watchful and sardonic.
“Now you drink—Mother—while I watch,” she said. “There’s a—dear. I’ll bet you can’t drink
two without stopping.”
“Don’t bet me, Kate. You’d lose. I can drink six without stopping.”
“Let me see you.”
“If I do, will you?”
“Of course.”
The contest started, and a puddle of wine spread out over the tabletop and the wine went down in
the mag-num.
Faye giggled. “When I was a girl—I could tell you stories maybe you wouldn’t believe.”
Kate said, “I could tell stories nobody would be-lieve.”
“You? Don’t be silly. You’re a child.”
Kate laughed. “You never saw such a child. This is a child—yes—a child!” She laughed with a
thin penetrat-ing shriek.
The sound got through the wine that was muffling Faye. She centered her eyes on Kate. “You
look so strange,” she said. “I guess it’s the lamplight. You look different.”
“I am different.”
“Call me ‘Mother,’ dear.”
“Mother—dear.”
“Kate, we’re going to have such a good life.”
“You bet we are. You don’t even know. You don’t know.”
“I’ve always wanted to go to Europe. We could get on a ship and have nice clothes—dresses
from Paris.”
“Maybe we’ll do that—but not now.”
“Why not, Kate? I have plenty of money.”
“We’ll have plenty more.”
Faye spoke pleadingly, “Why don’t we go now? We could sell the house. With the business
we’ve got, we could get maybe ten thousand dollars for it.”
“No.”
“What do you mean, no? It’s my house. I can sell it.”
“Did you forget I’m your daughter?”

“I don’t like your tone, Kate. What’s the matter with you? Is there any more wine?”
“Sure, there’s a little. Look at it through the bottle. Here, drink it out of the bottle. That’s right—
Mother—spill it down your neck. Get it in under your corset, Mother, against your fat stomach.”
Faye wailed, “Kate, don’t be mean! We were feeling so nice. What do you want to go and spoil it
for?”
Kate wrenched the bottle from her hand. “Here, give me that.” She tipped it up and drained it and
dropped it on the floor. Her face was sharp and her eyes glinted. The lips of her little mouth were
parted to show her small sharp teeth, and the canines were longer and more pointed than the
others. She laughed softly. “Mother—dear Mother—I’m going to show you how to run a
whorehouse. We’ll fix the gray slugs that come in here and dump their nasty little loads—for a
dollar. We’ll give them pleasure, Mother dear.”
Faye said sharply. “Kate, you’re drunk. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“You don’t, Mother dear? Do you want me to tell you?”
“I want you to be sweet. I want you to be like you were.”
“Well, it’s too late. I didn’t want to drink the wine. But you, you nasty fat worm, you made me.
I’m your dear, sweet daughter—don’t you remember? Well, I remember how surprised you were
that I had regulars. Do you think I’ll give them up? Do you think they give me a mean little dollar
in quarters? No, they give me ten dollars, and the price is going up all the time. They can’t go to
anybody else. Nobody else is any good for them.”
Faye wept like a child. “Kate,” she said, “don’t talk like that. You’re not like that. You’re not like
that.”
“Dear Mother, sweet fat Mother, take down the pants of one of my regulars. Look at the
heelmarks on the groin—very pretty. And the little cuts that bleed for a long time. Oh, Mother
dear, I’ve got the sweetest set of razors all in a case—and so sharp, so sharp.”
Faye struggled to get out of her chair. Kate pushed her back. “And do you know, Mother dear,
that’s the way this whole house is going to be. The price will be twenty dollars, and we’ll make
the bastards take a bath. We’ll catch the blood on white silk handkerchiefs—Mother dear—blood
from the little knotted whips.”
In her chair Faye began to scream hoarsely. Kate was on her instantly with a hard hand cupped
over her mouth. “Don’t make a noise. There’s a good darling. Get snot all over your daughter’s
hand—but no noise.” Tentatively she took her hand away and wiped it on Faye’s skirt.
Faye whispered, “I want you out of the house. I want you out. I run a good house without
nastiness. I want you out.”
“I can’t go, Mother. I can’t leave you alone, poor dear.” Her voice chilled. “Now I’m sick of you.
Sick of you.” She took a wineglass from the table, went to the bureau, and poured paregoric until
the glass was half full. “Here, Mother, drink it. It will be good for you.”
“I don’t want to.”
“There’s a good dear. Drink it.” She coaxed the fluid into Faye. “Now one more swallow—just
one more.”
Faye mumbled thickly for a while and then she relaxed in her chair and slept, snoring thickly.

3
Dread began to gather in the corners of Kate’s mind, and out of dread came panic. She
remembered the other time and a nausea swept through her. She gripped her hands together, and
the panic grew. She lighted a candle from the lamp and went unsteadily down the dark hall to the
kitchen. She poured dry mustard in a glass, stirred water into it until it was partly fluid, and drank
it. She held on to the edge of the sink while the paste went burning down. She retched and
strained again and again. At the end of it, her heart was pound-ing and she was weak—but the
wine was overcome and her mind was clear.
She went over the evening in her mind, moving from scene to scene like a sniffing animal. She
bathed her face and washed out the sink and put the mustard back on the shelf. Then she went
back to Faye’s room.
The dawn was coming, lighting up the back of Fré-mont’s Peak so that it stood black against the
sky. Faye was still snoring in her chair. Kate watched her for a few moments and then she fixed
Faye’s bed. Kate dragged and strained and lifted the dead weight of the sleeping woman. On the
bed Kate undressed Faye and washed her face and put her clothes away.
The day was coming fast. Kate sat beside the bed and watched the relaxed face, the mouth open,
lips blowing in and out.
Faye made a restless movement and her dry lips slobbered a few thick words and sighed off to a
snore again.
Kate’s eyes become alert. She opened the top bureau drawer and examined the bottles which
constituted the medicine chest of the house—paregoric, Pain Killer, Lydia Pinkham, iron wine
tonic, Hall’s Cream Salve, Epsom salts, castor oil, ammonia. She carried the am-monia bottle to
the bed, saturated a handkerchief, and, standing well away, held the cloth over Faye’s nose and
mouth.
The strangling, shocking fumes went in, and Faye came snorting and fighting out of her black
web. Her eyes were wide and terrified.
Kate said, “It’s all right, Mother. It’s all right. You had a nightmare. You had a bad dream.”
“Yes, a dream,” and then sleep overcame her again and she fell back and began to snore, but the
shock of the ammonia had lifted her up nearer consciousness and she was more restless. Kate put
the bottle back in its drawer. She straightened the table, mopped up the spilled wine, and carried
the glasses to the kitchen.
The house was dusky with dawnlight creeping in around the edges of the blinds. The cook stirred
in his lean-to behind the kitchen, groping for his clothes and putting on his clodhopper shoes.
Kate moved quietly. She drank two glasses of water and filled the glass again and carried it back
to Faye’s room and closed the door. She lifted Faye’s right eye-lid, and the eye looked rakishly
up at her but it was not rolled back in her head. Kate acted slowly and precise-ly. She picked up
the handkerchief and smelled it. Some of the ammonia had evaporated but the smell was still
sharp. She laid the cloth lightly over Faye’s face, and when Faye twisted and turned and came
near to waking, Kate took the handkerchief away and let Faye sink back. This she did three times.
She put the hand-kerchief away and picked up an ivory crochet hook from the marble top of the

bureau. She turned down the cover and pressed the blunt end of the ivory against Faye’s flabby
breast with a steady, increasing pressure until the sleeping woman whined and writhed. Then
Kate explored the sensitive places of the body with the hook—under the arm, the groin, the ear,
the clitoris, and always she removed the pressure just before Faye awakened fully.
Faye was very near the surface now. She whined and sniffled and tossed. Kate stroked her
forehead and ran smooth fingers over her inner arm and spoke softly to her.
“Dear—dear. You’re having a bad dream. Come out of the bad dream, Mother.”
Faye’s breathing grew more regular. She heaved a great sigh and turned on her side and settled
down with little grunts of comfort.
Kate stood up from the bed and a wave of dizziness rose in her head. She steadied herself, then
went to the door and listened, slipped out, and moved cautiously to her own room. She undressed
quickly and put on her nightgown and a robe and slippers. She brushed her hair and put it up and
covered it with a sleeping cap, and she sponged her face with Florida water. She went quietly
back to Faye’s room.
Faye was still sleeping peacefully on her side. Kate opened the door to the hall. She carried the
glass of water to the bed and poured cold water in Faye’s ear.
Faye screamed, and screamed again. Ethel’s fright-ened face looked out of her room in time to
see Kate in robe and slippers at Faye’s door. The cook was right behind Kate, and he put out his
hand to stop her.
“Now don’t go in there, Miss Kate. You don’t know what’s in there.”
“Nonsense, Faye’s in trouble.” Kate burst in and ran to the bed.
Faye’s eyes were wild and she was crying and moan-ing.
“What is it? What is it, dear?”
The cook was in the middle of the room, and three sleep-haggard girls stood in the doorway.
“Tell me, what is it?” Kate cried.
“Oh, darling—the dreams, the dreams! I can’t stand them!”
Kate turned to the door. “She’s had a nightmare—she’ll be all night. You go back to bed. I’ll stay
with her a while. Alex, bring a pot of tea.”
Kate was tireless. The other girls remarked on it. She put cold towels on Faye’s aching head and
held her shoulders and the cup of tea for her. She petted and babied her, but the look of horror
would not go out of Faye’s eyes. At ten o’clock Alex brought in a can of beer and without a word
put it on the bureau top. Kate held a glass of it to Faye’s lips.
“It will help, darling. Drink it down.”
“I never want another drink.”
“Nonsense! Drink it down like medicine. That’s a good girl. Now just lie back and go to sleep.”
“I’m afraid to sleep.”
“Were the dreams so bad?”
“Horrible, horrible!”
“Tell me about them, Mother. Maybe that will help.”
Faye shrank back. “I wouldn’t tell anyone. How I could have dreamed them! They weren’t like

my dreams.”
“Poor little Mother! Ilove you,” Kate said. “You go to sleep. I’ll keep the dreams away.”
Gradually Faye did slip off to sleep. Kate sat beside the bed, studying her.

Chapter 21
1
In human affairs of danger and delicacy successful conclusion is sharply limited by hurry. So
often men trip by being in a rush. If one were properly to perform a difficult and subtle act, he
should first inspect the end to be achieved and then, once he had accepted the end as desirable, he
should forget it completely and concen-trate solely on the means. By this method he would not be
moved to false action by anxiety or hurry or fear. Very few people learn this.
What made Kate so effective was the fact that she had either learned it or had been born with the
knowledge. Kate never hurried. If a barrier arose, she waited until it had disappeared before
continuing. She was capable of complete relaxation between the times for action. Also, she was
mistress of a technique which is the basis of good wrestling—that of letting your opponent do the
heavy work toward his own defeat, or of guiding his strength toward his weaknesses.
Kate was in no hurry. She thought to the end very quickly and then put it out of her mind. She set
herself to work on method. She built a structure and attacked it, and if it showed the slightest
shakiness she tore it down and started fresh. This she did only late at night or otherwise when she
was completely alone, so that no change or preoccupation was noticeable in her manner. Her
building was constructed of personalities, materi-als, knowledge, and time. She had access to the
first and last, and she set about getting knowledge and materials, but while she did that she set in
motion a series of imperceptible springs and pendulums and left them to pick up their own
momenta.
First the cook told about the will. It must have been the cook. He thought he did anyway. Kate
heard about it from Ethel, and she confronted him in the kitchen where he was kneading bread,
his hairy big arms floured to the elbows and his hands yeast bleached.
“Do you think it was a good thing to tell about being a witness?” she said mildly. “What do you
think Miss Faye is going to think?”
He looked confused. “But I didn’t—”
“You didn’t what—tell about it or think it would hurt?”
“I don’t think I—”
“You don’t think you told? Only three people knew. Do you think I told? Or do you think Miss
Faye did?” She saw the puzzled look come into his eyes and knew that by now he was far from
sure that he had not told. In a moment he would be sure that he had.
Three of the girls questioned Kate about the will, coming to her together for mutual strength.
Kate said, “I don’t think Faye would like me to discuss it. Alex should have kept his mouth shut.”
Their wills wavered, and she said, “Why don’t you ask Faye?”
“Oh, we wouldn’t do that!”

“But you dare to talk behind her back! Come on now, let’s go in to her and you can ask her the
ques-tions.”
“No, Kate, no.”
“Well, I’ll have to tell her you asked. Wouldn’t you rather be there? Don’t you think she would
feel better if she knew you weren’t talking behind her back?”
“Well—”
“I know I would. I always like a person who comes right out.” Quietly she surrounded and
nudged and pushed until they stood in Faye’s room.
Kate said, “They asked me about a certain you-know-what. Alex admits he let it out.”
Faye was slightly puzzled. “Well, dear, I can’t see that it’s such a secret.”
Kate said, “Oh, I’m glad you feel that way. But you can see that I couldn’t mention it until you
did.”
“You think it’s bad to tell, Kate?”
“Oh, not at all. I’m glad, but it seemed to me that it wouldn’t be loyal of me to mention it before
you did.”
“You’re sweet, Kate. I don’t see any harm. You see, girls, I’m alone in the world and I have taken
Kate as my daughter. She takes such care of me. Get the box, Kate.”
And each girl took the will in her own hands and inspected it. It was so simple they could repeat
it word for word to the other girls.
They watched Kate to see how she would change, perhaps become a tyrant, but if anything, she
was nicer to them.
A week later when Kate became ill, she went right on with her supervision of the house, and no
one would have known if she hadn’t been found standing rigid in the hall with agony printed on
her face. She begged the girls not to tell Faye, but they were outraged, and it was Faye who
forced her to bed and called Dr. Wilde.
He was a nice man and a pretty good doctor. He looked at her tongue, felt her pulse, asked her a
few intimate questions, and then tapped his lower lip.
“Right here?” he asked and exerted a little pressure on the small of her back. “No? Here? Does
this hurt? So. Well, I think you just need a kidney flushing.” He left yellow, green, and red pills
to be taken in sequence. The pills did good work.
She did have one little flare up. She told Faye, “I’ll go to the doctor’s office.”
“I’ll ask him to come here.”
“To bring me some more pills? Nonsense. I’ll go in the morning.”

2
Dr. Wilde was a good man and an honest man. He was accustomed to say of his profession that
all he was sure of was that sulphur would cure the itch. He was not casual about his practice. Like
so many country doc-tors, he was a combination doctor, priest, psychiatrist to his town. He knew
most of the secrets, weaknesses, and the braveries of Salinas. He never learned to take death
easily. Indeed the death of a patient always gave him a sense of failure and hopeless ignorance.

He was not a bold man, and he used surgery only as a last and fearful resort. The drugstore was
coming in to help the doctors, but Dr. Wilde was one of the few to maintain his own dispensary
and to compound his own prescrip-tions. Many years of overwork and interrupted sleep had made
him a little vague and preoccupied.
At eight-thirty on a Wednesday morning Kate walked up Main Street, climbed the stairs of the
Mon-terey County Bank Building, and walked along the corridor until she found the door which
said, “Dr. Wilde—Office Hours 11-2.”
At nine-thirty Dr. Wilde put his buggy in the livery stable and wearily lifted out his black bag. He
had been out in the Alisal presiding at the disintegration of old, old lady German. She had not
been able to terminate her life neatly. There were codicils. Even now Dr. Wilde wondered
whether the tough, dry, stringy life was completely gone out of her. She was ninety-seven and a
death certificate meant nothing to her. Why, she had corrected the priest who prepared her. The
mystery of death was on him. It often was. Yesterday, Allen Day, thirty-seven, six feet one inch,
strong as a bull and valuable to four hundred acres and a large family, had meekly surrendered his
life to pneumonia after a little exposure and three days of fever. Dr. Wilde knew it was a mystery.
His eyelids felt grainy. He thought he would take a sponge bath and have a drink before his first
office patients arrived with their stomach aches.
He climbed the stairs and put his worn key in the lock of his office door. The key would not turn.
He set his bag on the floor and exerted pressure. The key refused to budge. He grabbed the
doorknob and pulled outward and rattled the key. The door was opened from within. Kate stood
in front of him.
“Oh, good morning. Lock was stuck. How did you get in?”
“It wasn’t locked. I was early and came in to wait.”
“Wasn’t locked?” He turned the key the other way and saw that, sure enough, the little bar
slipped out easily.
“I’m getting old, I guess,” he said. “I’m forgetful.” He sighed. “I don’t know why I lock it
anyway. You could get in with a piece of baling wire. And who’d want to get in anyway?” He
seemed to see her for the first time. “I don’t have office hours until eleven.”
Kate said, “I needed some more of those pills and I couldn’t come later.”
“Pills? Oh, yes. You’re the girl from down at Faye’s.”
“That’s right.”
“Feeling better?”
“Yes, the pills help.”
“Well, they can’t hurt,” he said. “Did I leave the door to the dispensary open too?”
“What’s a dispensary?”
“Over there—that door.”
“I guess you must have.”
“Getting old. How is Faye?”
“Well, I’m worried about her. She was real sick a while ago. Had cramps and went a little out of
her head.”

“She’s had a stomach disorder before,” Dr. Wilde said. “You can’t live like that and eat at all
hours and be very well. I can’t anyway. We just call it stomach trouble. Comes from eating too
much and staying up all night. Now—the pills. Do you remember what color?”
“There were three kinds, yellow, red, and green.”
“Oh, yes. Yes, I remember.”
While he poured pills into a round cardboard box she stood in the door.
“What a lot of medicines!”
Dr. Wilde said, “Yes—and the older I get, the fewer I use. I got some of those when I started to
practice. Never used them. That’s a beginner’s stock. I was going to experiment—alchemy.”
“What?”
“Nothing. Here you are. Tell Faye to get some sleep and eat some vegetables. I’ve been up all
night. Let yourself out, will you?” He went wavering back into the surgery.
Kate glanced after him and then her eyes flicked over the lines of bottles and containers. She
closed the dis-pensary door and looked around the outer office. One book in the case was out of
line. She pushed it back until it was shoulder to shoulder with its brothers.
She picked up her big handbag from the leather sofa and left.
In her own room Kate took five small bottles and a strip of scribbled paper from her handbag.
She put the whole works in the toe of a stocking, pushed the wad into a rubber overshoe, and
stood it with its fellow in the back of her closet.

3
During the following months a gradual change came over Faye’s house. The girls were sloppy
and touchy. If they had been told to clean themselves and their rooms a deep resentment would
have set in and the house would have reeked of ill temper. But it didn’t work that way.
Kate said at table one evening that she had just happened to look in Ethel’s room and it was so
neat and pretty she couldn’t help buying her a present. When Ethel unwrapped the package right
at the table it was a big bottle of Hoyt’s German, enough to keep her smelling sweet for a long
time. Ethel was pleased, and she hoped Kate hadn’t seen the dirty clothes under the bed. After
supper she not only got the clothes out but brushed the floors and swept the cobwebs out of the
corners.
Then Grace looked so pretty one afternoon that Kate couldn’t help giving her the rhinestone
butterfly pin she was wearing. And Grace had to rush up and put on a clean shirtwaist to set it off.
Alex in the kitchen, who, if he had believed what was usually said of him would have considered
himself a murderer, found that he had a magic hand with biscuits. He discovered that cooking
was something you couldn’t learn. You had to feel it.
Cotton Eye learned that nobody hated him. His tub-thumping piano playing changed
imperceptibly.
He told Kate, “It’s funny what you remember when you think back.”
“Like what?” she asked.
“Well, like this,” and he played for her.

“That’s lovely,” she said. “What is it?”
“Well, I don’t know. I think it’s Chopin. If I could just see the music!”
He told her how he had lost his sight, and he had never told anyone else. It was a bad story. That
Satur-day night he took the chain off the piano strings and played something he had been
remembering and practic-ing in the morning, something called “Moonlight,” a piece by
Beethoven, Cotton Eye thought.
Ethel said it sounded like moonlight and did he know the words.
“It don’t have words,” said Cotton Eye.
Oscar Trip, up from Gonzales for Saturday night, said, “Well, it ought to have. It’s pretty.”
One night there were presents for everyone because Faye’s was the best house, the cleanest, and
nicest in the whole county—and who was responsible for that? Why, the girls—who else? And
did they ever taste seasoning like in that stew?
Alex retired into the kitchen and shyly wiped his eyes with the back of his wrist. He bet he could
make a plum pudding would knock their eyes out.
Georgia was getting up at ten every morning and taking piano lessons from Cotton Eye and her
nails were clean.
Coming back from eleven o’clock mass on a Sunday morning, Grace said to Trixie, “And I was
about ready to get married and give up whoring. Can you imag-ine?”
“It’s sure nice,” said Trixie. “Jenny’s girls came over for Faye’s birthday cake and they couldn’t
believe their eyes. They don’t talk about nothing else but how it is at Faye’s. Jenny’s sore.”
“Did you see the score on the blackboard this morn-ing?”
“Sure I did—eighty-seven tricks in one week. Let Jenny or the Nigger match that when there
ain’t no holidays!”
“No holidays, hell. Have you forgot it’s Lent? They ain’t turning a trick at Jenny’s.”
After her illness and her evil dreams Faye was quiet and depressed. Kate knew she was being
watched, but there was no help for that. And she had made sure the rolled paper was still in the
box and all the girls had seen it or heard about it.
One afternoon Faye looked up from her solitaire game as Kate knocked and entered the room.
“How do you feel, Mother?”
“Fine, just fine.” Her eyes were secretive. Faye wasn’t very clever. “You know, Kate, I’d like to
go to Europe.”
“Well, how wonderful! And you deserve it and you can afford it.”
“I don’t want to go alone. I want you to go with me.”
Kate looked at her in astonishment. “Me? You want to take me?”
“Sure, why not?”
“Oh, you sweet dear! When can we go?”
“You want to?”
“I’ve always dreamed of it. When can we go? Let’s go soon.”
Faye’s eyes lost their suspicion and her face relaxed. “Maybe next summer,” she said. “We can
plan it for next summer. Kate!”

“Yes, Mother.”
“You—you don’t turn any tricks any more, do you?”
“Why should I? You take such good care of me.”
Faye slowly gathered up the cards, and tapped them square, and dropped them in the table drawer.
Kate pulled up a chair. “I want to ask your advice about something.”
“What is it?”
“Well, you know I’m trying to help you.”
“You’re doing everything, darling.”
“You know our biggest expense is food, and it gets bigger in the winter.”
“Yes.”
“Well, right now you can buy fruit and all kinds of vegetables for two bits a lug. And in the
winter you know what we pay for canned peaches and canned string beans.”
“You aren’t planning to start preserving?”
“Well, why shouldn’t we?”
“What will Alex say to that?”
“Mother, you can believe it or not, or you can ask him. Alex suggested it.”
“No!”
“Well, he did. Cross my heart.”
“Well, I’ll be damned—Oh, I’m sorry, sweet. It slipped out.”
The kitchen turned into a cannery and all the girls helped. Alex truly believed it was his idea. At
the end of the season he had a silver watch with his name engraved on the back to prove it.
Ordinarily both Faye and Kate had their supper at the long table in the dining room, but on
Sunday nights when Alex was off and the girls dined on thick sand-wiches, Kate served supper
for two in Faye’s room. It was pleasant and a ladylike time. There was always some little
delicacy, very special and good—foie gras or a tossed salad, pastry bought at Lang’s Bakery just
across Main Street. And instead of the white oilcloth and paper napkins of the dining room,
Faye’s table was covered with a white damask cloth and the napkins were linen. It had a party
feeling too, candles and—something rare in Salinas—a bowl of flowers. Kate could make pretty
floral arrangements using only the blossoms from weeds she picked in the fields.
“What a clever girl she is,” Faye would say. “She can do anything and she can make do with
anything. We’re going to Europe. And did you know Kate speaks French? Well, she can. When
you get her alone ask her to say something in French. She’s teaching me. Know how you say
bread in French?” Faye was having a wonderful time. Kate gave her excitement and perpetu-al
planning.

4
On Saturday the fourteenth of October the first wild ducks went over Salinas. Faye saw them
from her window, a great wedge flying south. When Kate came in before supper, as she always
did, Faye told her about it. “I guess the winter’s nearly here,” she said. “We’ll have to get Alex to
set up the stoves.”

“Ready for your tonic, Mother dear?”
“Yes, I am. You’re making me lazy, waiting on me.”
“I like to wait on you,” said Kate. She took the bottle of Lydia Pinkham’s Vegetable Compound
from the drawer and held it up to the light. “Not much left,” she said. “We’ll have to get some
more.”
“Oh, I think I have three bottles left of the dozen in my closet.”
Kate picked up the glass. “There’s a fly in the glass,” she said. “I’ll just go and wash it out.”
In the kitchen she rinsed the glass. From her pocket she took the eye-dropper. The end was closed
with a little piece of potato, the way you plug the spout of a kerosene can. She carefully squeezed
a few drops of clear liquid into the glass, a tincture of nux vomica.
Back in Faye’s room she poured the three table-spoons of vegetable compound in the glass and
stirred it.
Faye drank her tonic and licked her lips. “It tastes bitter,” she said.
“Does it, dear? Let nie taste.” Kate took a spoonful from the bottle and made a face. “So it does,”
she said. “I guess it’s been standing around too long. I’m going to throw it out. Say, that is bitter.
Let me get you a glass of water.”
At supper Faye’s face was flushed. She stopped eating and seemed to be listening.
“What’s the matter?” Kate asked. “Mother, what’s the matter?”
Faye seemed to tear her attention away. “Why, I don’t know. I guess a little heart flutter. Just all
of a sudden I felt afraid and my heart got to pounding.”
“Don’t you want me to help you to your room?”
“No, dear, I feel all right now.”
Grace put down her fork. “Well, you got a real high flush, Faye.”
Kate said, “I don’t like it. I wish you’d see Dr. Wilde.”
“No, it’s all right now.”
“You frightened me,” said Kate. “Have you ever had it before?”
“Well, I’m a little short of breath sometimes. I guess I’m getting too stout.”
Faye didn’t feel very good that Saturday night and about ten o’clock Kate persuaded her to go to
bed. Kate looked in several times until she was sure Faye was asleep.
The next day Faye felt all right. “I guess I’m just short-winded,” she said.
“Well, we’re going to have invalid food for my dar-ling,” said Kate. “I’ve made some chicken
soup for you, and we’ll have a string-bean salad—the way you like it, just oil and vinegar, and a
cup of tea.”
“Honest to God, Kate. I feel pretty good.”
“It wouldn’t hurt either of us to eat a little light. You frightened me last night. I had an aunt who
died of heart trouble. And that leaves a memory, you know.”
“I never had any trouble with my heart. Just a little short-winded when I climb the stairs.”
In the kitchen Kate set the supper on two trays. She measured out the French dressing in a cup
and poured it on the string-bean salad. On Faye’s tray she put her favorite cup and set the soup
forward on the stove to heat. Finally she took the eye-dropper from her pocket and squeezed two

drops of crotón oil on the string beans and stirred it in. She went to her room and swallowed the
contents of a small bottle of Cascara Sagrada and hurried back to the kitchen. She poured the hot
soup in the cups, filled the teapot with boiling water, and carried the trays to Faye’s room.
“I didn’t think I was hungry,” Faye said. “But that soup smells good.”
“I made a special salad dressing for you,” said Kate. “It’s an old recipe, rosemary and thyme. See
if you like it.”
“Why, it’s delicious,” said Faye. “Is there anything you can’t do darling?”
Kate was stricken first. Her forehead beaded with perspiration and she doubled over, crying with
pain. Her eyes were staring and the saliva ran from her mouth. Faye ran to the hallway, screaming
for help. The girls and a few Sunday customers crowded into the room. Kate was writhing on the
floor. Two of the regu-lars lifted her onto Faye’s bed and tried to straighten her out, but she
screamed and doubled up again. The sweat poured from her body and wet her clothes.
Faye was wiping Kate’s forehead with a towel when the pain struck her.
It was an hour before Dr. Wilde could be found playing euchre with a friend. He was dragged
down to the Line by two hysterical whores. Faye and Kate were weak from vomiting and diarrhea
and the spasms con-tinued at intervals.
Dr. Wilde said, “What did you eat?” And then he noticed the trays. “Are these string beans home
canned?” he demanded.
“Sure,” said Grace. “We did them right here.”
“Did any of you have them?”
“Well, no. You see—”
“Go out and break every jar,” Dr. Wilde said. “God-dam the string beans!” And he unpacked his
stomach pump.
On Tuesday he sat with the two pale weak women. Kate’s bed had been moved into Faye’s room.
“I can tell you now,” he said. “I didn’t think you had a chance. You’re pretty lucky. And let homemade string beans alone. Buy canned ones.”
“What is it?” Kate asked.
“Botulism. We don’t know much about it, but damn few ever get over it. I guess it’s because
you’re young and she’s tough.” He asked Faye, “Are you still bleed-ing from the bowels?”
“Yes, a little.”
“Well, here are some morphine pills. They’ll bind you up. You’ve probably ruptured something.
But they say you can’t kill a whore. Now take it easy, both of you.”
That was October 17.
Faye was never really well again. She would make a little gain and then go to pieces. She had a
bad time on December 3, and it took even longer for her to gain her strength. February 12 the
bleeding became violent and the strain seemed to have weakened Faye’s heart. Dr. Wilde listened
a long time through his stethoscope.
Kate was haggard and her slender body had shrunk to bones. The girls tried to spell her with
Faye, but Kate would not leave.
Grace said, “God knows when’s the last sleep she had. If Faye was to die I think it would kill that

girl.”
“She’s just as like to blow her brains out,” said Ethel.
Dr. Wilde took Kate into the day-darkened parlor and put his black bag on the chair. “I might as
well tell you,” he said. “Her heart just can’t take the strain, I’m afraid. She’s all torn up inside.
That goddam botulism. Worse than a rattlesnake.” He looked away from Kate’s haggard face. “I
thought it would be better to tell you so you can prepare yourself,” he said lamely and put his
hand on her bony shoulder. “Not many people have such loyalty. Give her a little warm milk if
she can take it.”
Kate carried a basin of warm water to the table beside the bed. When Trixie looked in, Kate was
bath-ing Faye and using the fine linen napkins to do it. Then she brushed the lank blond hair and
braided it.
Faye’s skin had shrunk, clinging to jaw and skull, and her eyes were huge and vacant.
She tried to speak, and Kate said, “Shush! Save your strength. Save your strength.”
She went to the kitchen for a glass of warm milk and put it on the bedside table. She took two
little bottles from her pocket and sucked a little from each one into the eye-dropper. “Open up,
Mother. This is a new kind of medicine. Now be brave, dear. This will taste bad.” She squeezed
the fluid far back on Faye’s tongue and held up her head so she could drink a little milk to take
away the taste. “Now you rest and I’ll be back in a little while.”
Kate slipped quietly out of the room. The kitchen was dark. She opened the outer door and crept
out and moved back among the weeds. The ground was damp from the spring rains. At the back
of the lot she dug a small hole with a pointed stick. She dropped in a number of small thin bottles
and an eye-dropper. With the stick she crushed the glass to bits and scraped dirt over them. Rain
was beginning to fall as Kate went back to the house.
At first they had to tie Kate down to keep her from hurting herself. From violence she went into a
gloomy stupor. It was a long time before she regained her health. And she forgot completely
about the will. It was Trixie who finally remembered.

Chapter 22
1
On the Trask place Adam drew into himself. The unfin-ished Sanchez house lay open to wind
and rain, and the new floorboards buckled and warped with mois-ture. The laid-out vegetable
gardens rioted with weeds.
Adam seemed clothed in a viscosity that slowed his movements and held his thoughts down. He
saw the world through gray water. Now and then his mind fought its way upward, and when the
light broke in it brought him only a sickness of the mind, and he retired into the grayness again.
He was aware of the twins because he heard them cry and laugh, but he felt only a thin distaste
for them. To Adam they were symbols of his loss. His neighbors drove up into his little valley,
and every one of them would have understood anger or sorrow—and so helped him. But they
could do nothing with the cloud that hung over him. Adam did not resist them. He simply did not
see them, and before long the neighbors stopped driving up the road under the oaks.
For a time Lee tried to stimulate Adam to awareness, but Lee was a busy man. He cooked and
washed, he bathed the twins and fed them. Through his hard and constant work he grew fond of
the two little boys. He talked to them in Cantonese, and Chinese words were the first they
recognized and tried to repeat.
Samuel Hamilton went back twice to try to wedge Adam up and out of his shock. Then Liza
stepped in.
“I want you to stay away from there,” she said. “You come back a changed man. Samuel, you
don’t change him. He changes you. I can see the look of him in your face.”
“Have you thought of the two little boys, Liza?” he asked.
“I’ve thought of your own family,” she said snap-pishly. “You lay a crepe on us for days after.”
“All right, Mother,” he said, but it saddened him because Samuel could not mind his own
business when there was pain in any man. It was no easy thing for him to abandon Adam to his
desolation.
Adam had paid him for his work, had even paid him for the windmill parts and did not want the
windmills. Samuel sold the equipment and sent Adam the money. He had no answer.
He became aware of an anger at Adam Trask. It seemed to Samuel that Adam might be
pleasuring him-self with sadness. But there was little leisure to brood. Joe was off to college—to
that school Leland Stanford had built on his farm near Palo Alto. Tom worried his father, for
Tom grew deeper and deeper into books. He did his work well enough, but Samuel felt that Tom
had not joy enough.
Will and George were doing well in business, and Joe was writing letters home in rhymed verse
and making as smart an attack on all the accepted verities as was healthful.

Samuel wrote to Joe, saying, “I would be disappoint-ed if you had not become an atheist, and I
read pleas-antly that you have, in your age and wisdom, accepted agnosticism the way you’d take
a cookie on a full stomach. But I would ask you with all my understand-ing heart not to try to
convert your mother. Your last letter only made her think you are not well. Your mother does not
believe there are many ills uncurable by good strong soup. She puts your brave attack on the
structure of our civilization down to a stomach ache. It worries her. Her faith is a mountain, and
you, my son, haven’t even got a shovel yet.”
Liza was getting old. Samuel saw it in her face, and he could not feel old himself, white beard or
no. But Liza was living backwards, and that’s the proof.
There was a time when she looked on his plans and prophecies as the crazy shoutings of a child.
Now she felt that they were unseemly in a grown man. They three, Liza and Tom and Samuel,
were alone on the ranch. Una was married to a stranger and gone away. Dessie had her
dressmaking business in Salinas. Olive had married her young man, and Mollie was married and
living, believe it or not, in an apartment in San Francisco. There was perfume, and a white
bearskin rug in the bedroom in front of the fireplace, and Mollie smoked a gold-tipped cigarette—
Violet Milo—with her coffee after dinner.
One day Samuel strained his back lifting a bale of hay, and it hurt his feelings more than his back,
for he could not imagine a life in which Sam Hamilton was not privileged to lift a bale of hay. He
felt insulted by his back, almost as he would have been if one of his children had been dishonest.
In King City, Dr. Tilson felt him over. The doctor grew more testy with his overworked years.
“You sprained your back.”
“That I did,” said Samuel.
“And you drove all the way in to have me tell you that you sprained your back and charge you
two dol-lars?”
“Here’s your two dollars.”
“And you want to know what to do about it?”
“Sure I do.”
“Don’t sprain it any more. Now take your money back. You’re not a fool, Samuel, unless you’re
getting childish.”
“But it hurts.”
“Of course it hurts. How would you know it was strained if it didn’t?”
Samuel laughed. “You’re good for me,” he said. “You’re more than two dollars good for me.
Keep the money.”
The doctor looked closely at him. “I think you’re telling the truth, Samuel. I’ll keep the money.”
Samuel went in to see Will in his fine new store. He hardly knew his son, for Will was getting fat
and prosperous and he wore a coat and vest and a gold ring on his little finger.
“I’ve got a package made up for Mother,” Will said. “Some little cans of things from France.
Mushrooms and liver paste and sardines so little you can hardly see them.”
“She’ll just send them to Joe,” said Samuel.
“Can’t you make her eat them?”

“No,” said his father. “But she’ll enjoy sending them to Joe.”
Lee came into the store and his eyes lighted up. “How do, Missy,” he said.
“Hello, Lee. How are the boys?”
“Boys fine.”
Samuel said, “I’m going to have a glass of beer next door, Lee. Be glad to have you join me.”
Lee and Samuel sat at the little round table in the barroom and Samuel drew figures on the
scrubbed wood with the moisture of his beer glass. “I’ve wanted to go to see you and Adam but I
didn’t think I could do any good.”
“Well, you can’t do any harm. I thought he’d get over it. But he still walks around like a ghost.”
“It’s over a year, isn’t it?” Samuel asked.
“Three months over.”
“Well, what do you think I can do?”
“I don’t know,” said Lee. “Maybe you could shock him out of it. Nothing else has worked.”
“I’m not good at shocking. I’d probably end up by shocking myself. By the way, what did he
name the twins?”
“They don’t have any names.”
“You’re making a joke, Lee.”
“I am not making jokes.”
“What does he call them?”
“He calls them ‘they.’ ”
“I mean when he speaks to them.”
“When he speaks to them he calls them ‘you,’ one or both.”
“This is nonsense,” Samuel said angrily. “What kind of fool is the man?”
“I’ve meant to come and tell you. He’s a dead man unless you can wake him up.”
Samuel said, “I’ll come. I’ll bring a horse whip. No names! You’re damn right I’ll come Lee.”
“When?”
“Tomorrow.”
“I’ll kill a chicken,” said Lee. “You’ll like the twins, Mr. Hamilton. They’re fine-looking boys. I
won’t tell Mr. Trask you’re coming.”

2
Shyly Samuel told his wife he wanted to visit the Trask place. He thought she would pile up
strong walls of objection, and for one of the few times in his life he would disobey her wish no
matter how strong her ob-jection. It gave him a sad feeling in the stomach to think of disobeying
his wife. He explained his purpose almost as though he were confessing. Liza put her hands on
her hips during the telling and his heart sank. When he was finished she continued to look at him,
he thought, coldly.
Finally she said, “Samuel, do you think you can move this rock of a man?”
“Why, I don’t know, Mother.” He had not expected this. “I don’t know.”
“Do you think it is such an important matter that those babies have names right now?”

“Well, it seemed so to me,” he said lamely.
“Samuel, do you think why you want to go? Is it your natural incurable nosiness? Is it your black
inabil-ity to mind your own business?”
“Now, Liza, I know my failings pretty well. I thought it might be more than that.”
“It had better be more than that,” she said. “This man has not admitted that his sons live. He has
cut them off mid-air.”
“That’s the way it seems to me, Liza.”
“If he tells you to mind your own business—what then?”
“Well, I don’t know.”
Her jaw snapped shut and her teeth clicked. “If you do not get those boys named, there’ll be no
warm place in this house for you. Don’t you dare come whining back, saying he wouldn’t do it or
he wouldn’t listen. If you do I’ll have to go myself.”
“I’ll give him the back of my hand,” Samuel said.
“No, that you won’t do. You fall short in savagery, Samuel. I know you. You’ll give him sweetsounding words and you’ll come dragging back and try to make me forget you ever went.”
“I’ll beat his brains out,” Samuel shouted.
He slammed into the bedroom, and Liza smiled at the panels.
He came out soon in his black suit and his hard shiny shirt and collar. He stooped down to her
while she tied his black string tie. His white beard was brushed to shining.
“You’d best take a swab at your shoes with a black-ing brush,” she said.
In the midst of painting the blacking on his worn shoes he looked sideways up at her. “Could I
take the Bible along?” he asked. “There’s no place for getting a good name like the Bible.”
“I don’t much like it out of the house,” she said uneasily. “And if you’re late coming home,
what’ll I have for my reading? And the children’s names are in it.” She saw his face fall. She
went into the bedroom and came back with a small Bible, worn and scuffed, its cover held on by
brown paper and glue. “Take this one,” she said.
“But that’s your mother’s.”
“She wouldn’t mind. And all the names but one in here have two dates.”
“I’ll wrap it so it won’t get hurt,” said Samuel.
Liza spoke sharply. “What my mother would mind is what I mind, and I’ll tell you what I mind.
You’re never satisfied to let the Testament alone. You’re for-ever picking at it and questioning it.
You turn it over the way a ’coon turns over a wet rock, and it angers me.”
“I’m just trying to understand it, Mother.”
“What is there to understand? Just read it. There it is in black and white. Who wants you to
understand it? If the Lord God wanted you to understand it He’d have given you to understand or
He’d have set it down different.”
“But, Mother—”
“Samuel,” she said, “you’re the most contentious man this world has ever seen.”
“Yes, Mother.”
“Don’t agree with me all the time. It hints of insin-cerity. Speak up for yourself.”

She looked after his dark figure in the buggy as he drove away. “He’s a sweet husband,” she said
aloud, “but contentious.”
And Samuel was thinking with wonder, Just when I think I know her she does a thing like that.

3
On the last half-mile, turning out of the Salinas Valley and driving up the unscraped road under
the great oak trees, Samuel tried to plait a rage to take care of his embarrassment. He said heroic
words to himself.
Adam was more gaunt than Samuel remembered. His eyes were dull, as though he did not use
them much for seeing. It took a little time for Adam to become aware that Samuel was standing
before him. A grimace of displeasure drew down his mouth.
Samuel said, “I feel small now—coming uninvited as I have.”
Adam said, “What do you want? Didn’t I pay you?”
“Pay?” Samuel asked. “Yes, you did. Yes, by God, you did. And I’ll tell you that pay has been
more than I’ve merited by the nature of it.”
“What? What are you trying to say?”
Samuel’s anger grew and put out leaves. “A man, his whole life, matches himself against pay.
And how, if it’s my whole life’s work to find my worth, can you, sad man, write me down instant
in a ledger?”
Adam exclaimed, “I’ll pay. I tell you I’ll pay. How much? I’ll pay.”
“You have, but not to me.”
“Why did you come then? Go away!”
“You once invited me.”
“I don’t invite you now.”
Samuel put his hands on his hips and leaned for-ward. “I’ll tell you now, quiet. In a bitter night, a
mustard night that was last night, a good thought came and the dark was sweetened when the day
sat down. And this thought went from evening star to the late dipper on the edge of the first light
—that our betters spoke of. So I invite myself.”
“You are not welcome.”
Samuel said, “I’m told that out of some singular glory your loins got twins.”
“What business is that of yours?”
A kind of joy lighted Samuel’s eyes at the rudeness. He saw Lee lurking inside the house and
peeking out at him. “Don’t, for the love of God, put violence on me. I’m a man hopes there’ll be
a picture of peace on my hatchments.”
“I don’t understand you.”
“How could you? Adam Trask, a dog wolf with a pair of cubs, a scrubby rooster with sweet
paternity for a fertilized egg! A dirty clod!”
A darkness covered Adam’s cheeks and for the first time his eyes seemed to see. Samuel joyously
felt hot rage in his stomach. He cried, “Oh, my friend, retreat from me! Please, I beg of you!” The
saliva dampened the corners of his mouth. “Please!” he cried. “For the love of any holy thing you

can remember, step back from me. I feel murder nudging my gizzard.”
Adam said, “Get off my place. Go on—get off. You’re acting crazy. Get off. This is my place. I
bought it.”
“You bought your eyes and nose,” Samuel jeered. “You bought your uprightness. You bought
your thumb on sideways. Listen to me, because I’m like to kill you after. You bought! You
bought out of some sweet inheritance. Think now—do you deserve your children, man?”
“Deserve them? They’re here—I guess. I don’t un-derstand you.”
Samuel wailed, “God save me, Liza! It’s not the way you think, Adam! Listen to me before my
thumb finds the bad place at your throat. The precious twins—untried, unnoticed, undirected—
and I say it quiet with my hands down—undiscovered.”
“Get off,” said Adam hoarsely. “Lee, bring a gun! This man is crazy. Lee!”
Then Samuel’s hands were on Adam’s throat, press-ing the throbbing up to his temples, swelling
his eyes with blood. And Samuel was snarling at him. “Tear away with your jelly fingers. You
have not bought these boys, nor stolen them, nor passed any bit for them. You have them by
some strange and lovely dispensation.” Suddenly he plucked his hard thumbs out of his neighbor’s throat.
Adam stood panting. He felt his throat where the blacksmith hands had been. “What is it you
want of me?”
“You have no love.”
“I had—enough to kill me.”
“No one ever had enough. The stone orchard cel-ebrates too little, not too much.”
“Stay away from me. I can fight back. Don’t think I can’t defend myself.”
“You have two weapons, and they not named.”
“I’ll fight you, old man. You are an old man.”
Samuel said, “I can’t think in my mind of a dull man picking up a rock, who before evening
would not put a name to it—like Peter. And you—for a year you’ve lived with your heart’s
draining and you’ve not even laid a number to the boys.”
Adam said, “What I do is my own business.”
Samuel struck him with a work-heavy fist, and Adam sprawled out in the dust. Samuel asked him
to rise, and when Adam accepted struck him again, and this time Adam did not get up. He looked
stonily at the menacing old man.
The fire went out of Samuel’s eyes and he said quietly, “Your sons have no names.”
Adam replied, “Their mother left them motherless.”
“And you have left them fatherless. Can’t you feel the cold at night of a lone child? What warm is
there, what bird song, what possible morning can be good? Don’t you remember, Adam, how it
was, even a little?”
“I didn’t do it,” Adam said.
“Have you undone it? Your boys have no names.” He stooped down and put his arms around
Adam’s shoulders and helped him to his feet. “We’ll give them names,” he said. “We’ll think
long and find good names to clothe them.” He whipped the dust from Adam’s shirt with his

hands.
Adam wore a faraway yet intent look, as though he were listening to some wind-carried music,
but his eyes were not dead as they had been. He said, “It’s hard to imagine I’d thank a man for
insults and for shaking me out like a rug. But I’m grateful. It’s a hurty thanks, but it’s thanks.”
Samuel smiled, crinkle-eyed. “Did it seem natural? Did I do it right?” he asked.
“What do you mean?”
“Well, in a way I promised my wife I’d do it. She didn’t believe I would. I’m not a fighting man,
you see. The last time I clobbered a human soul it was over a red-nosed girl and a Schoolbook in
County Derry.”
Adam stared at Samuel, but in his mind he saw and felt his brother Charles, black and murderous,
and that sight switched to Cathy and the quality of her eyes over the gun barrel. “There wasn’t
any fear in it,” Adam said. “It was more like a weariness.”
“I guess I was not angry enough.”
“Samuel, I’ll ask just once and then no more. Have you heard anything? Has there been any news
of her—any news at all?”
“I’ve heard nothing.”
“It’s almost a relief,” said Adam.
“Do you have hatred?”
“No. No—only a kind of sinking in the heart. Maybe later I’ll sort it out to hatred. There was no
interval from loveliness to horror, you see. I’m confused, confused.”
Samuel said, “One day we’ll sit and you’ll lay it out on the table, neat like a solitaire deck, but
now—why, you can’t find all the cards.”
From behind the shed there came the indignant shrieking of an outraged chicken and then a dull
thump.
“There’s something at the hens,” said Adam.
A second shrieking started. “It’s Lee at the hens,” said Samuel. “You know, if chickens had
government and church and history, they would take a distant and distasteful view of human joy.
Let any gay and hopeful thing happen to a man, and some chicken goes howling to the block.”
Now the two men were silent, breaking it only with small false courtesies—meaningless inquiries
about health and weather, with answers unlistened to. And this might have continued until they
were angry at each other again if Lee had not interfered.
Lee brought out a table and two chairs and set the chairs facing each other. He made another trip
for a pint of whisky and two glasses and set a glass on the table in front of each chair. Then he
carried out the twins, one under each arm, and put them on the ground beside the table and gave
each boy a stick for his hand to shake and make shadows with.
The boys sat solemnly and looked about, stared at Samuel’s beard and searched for Lee. The
strange thing about them was their clothing, for the boys were dressed in the straight trousers and
the frogged and braided jackets of the Chinese. One was in turquoise blue and the other in a faded
rose pink, and the frogs and braid were black. On their heads sat round black silken hats, each
with a bright red button on its flat top.

Samuel asked, “Where in the world did you get those clothes, Lee?”
“I didn’t get them,” Lee said testily. “I had them. The only other clothes they have I made myself,
out of sail cloth. A boy should be well dressed on his naming day.”
“You’ve dropped the pidgin, Lee.”
“I hope for good. Of course I use it in King City.” He addressed a few short sung syllables to the
boys on the ground, and they both smiled up at him and waved their sticks in the air. Lee said,
“I’ll pour you a drink. It’s some that was here.”
“It’s some you bought yesterday in King City,” said Samuel.
Now that Samuel and Adam were seated together and the barriers were down, a curtain of
shyness fell on Samuel. What he had beaten in with his fists he could not supplement easily. He
thought of the virtues of courage and forbearance, which become flabby when there is nothing to
use them on. His mind grinned inward at itself.
The two sat looking at the twin boys in their strange bright-colored clothes. Samuel thought,
Sometimes your opponent can help you more than your friend. He lifted his eyes to Adam.
“It’s hard to start,” he said. “And it’s like a put-off letter that gathers difficulties to itself out of
the min-utes. Could you give me a hand?”
Adam looked up for a moment and then back at the boys on the ground. “There’s a crashing in
my head,” he said. “Like sounds you hear under water. I’m hav-ing to dig myself out of a year.”
“Maybe you’ll tell me how it was and that will get us started.”
Adam tossed down his drink and poured another and rolled the glass at an angle in his hand. The
amber whisky moved high on the side and the pungent fruit odor of its warming filled the air.
“It’s hard to remem-ber,” he said. “It was not agony but a dullness. But no—there were needles in
it. You said I had not all the cards in the deck—and I was thinking of that. Maybe I’ll never have
all the cards.”
“Is it herself trying to come out? When a man says he does not want to speak of something he
usually means he can think of nothing else.”
“Maybe it’s that. She’s all mixed up with the dull-ness, and I can’t remember much except the
last picture drawn in fire.”
“She did shoot you, didn’t she, Adam?”
His lips grew thin and his eyes black.
Samuel said, “There’s no need to answer.”
“There’s no reason not to,” Adam replied. “Yes, she did.”
“Did she mean to kill you?”
“I’ve thought of that more than anything else. No, I don’t think she meant to kill me. She didn’t
allow me that dignity. There was no hatred in her, no passion at all. I learned about that in the
army. If you want to kill a man, you shoot at head or heart or stomach. No, she hit me where she
intended. I can see the gun barrel moving over. I guess I wouldn’t have minded so much if she
had wanted my death. That would have been a kind of love. But I was an annoyance, not an
enemy.”
“You’ve given it a lot of thought,” said Samuel.

“I’ve had lots of time for it. I want to ask you something. I can’t remember behind the last ugly
thing. Was she very beautiful, Samuel?”
“To you she was because you built her. I don’t think you ever saw her—only your own creation.”
Adam mused aloud, “I wonder who she was—what she was. I was content not to know.”
“And now you want to?”
Adam dropped his eyes. “It’s not curiosity. But I would like to know what kind of blood is in my
boys. When they grow up—won’t I be looking for something in them?”
“Yes, you will. And I will warn you now that not their blood but your suspicion might build evil
in them. They will be what you expect of them.”
“But their blood—”
“I don’t very much believe in blood,” said Samuel. “I think when a man finds good or bad in his
children he is seeing only what he planted in them after they cleared the womb.”
“You can’t make a race horse of a pig.”
“No,” said Samuel, “but you can make a very fast pig.”
“No one hereabouts would agree with you. I think even Mrs. Hamilton would not.”
“That’s exactly right. She most of all would disagree, and so I would not say it to her and let
loose the thunder of her disagreement. She wins all arguments by the use of vehemence and the
conviction that a differ-ence of opinion is a personal affront. She’s a fine wom-an, but you have
to learn to feel your way with her. Let’s speak of the boys.”
“Will you have another drink?”
“That I will, thank you. Names are a great mystery. I’ve never known whether the name is
molded by the child or the child changed to fit the name. But you can be sure of this—whenever a
human has a nickname it is a proof that the name given him was wrong. How do you favor the
standard names—John or James or Charles?”
Adam was looking at the twins and suddenly with the mention of the name he saw his brother
peering out of the eyes of one of the boys. He leaned forward.
“What is it?” Samuel asked.
“Why,” Adam cried, “these boys are not alike! They don’t look alike.”
“Of course they don’t. They’re not identical twins.”
“That one—that one looks like my brother. I just saw it. I wonder if the other looks like me.”
“Both of them do. A face has everything in it right back to the beginning.”
“It’s not so much now,” said Adam. “But for a moment I thought I was seeing a ghost.”
“Maybe that’s what ghosts are,” Samuel observed.
Lee brought dishes out and put them on the table.
“Do you have Chinese ghosts?” Samuel asked.
“Millions,” said Lee. “We have more ghosts than anything else. I guess nothing in China ever
dies. It’s very crowded. Anyway, that’s the feeling I got when I was there.”
Samuel said, “Sit down, Lee. We’re trying to think of names.”
“I’ve got chicken frying. It will be ready pretty soon.”
Adam looked up from the twins and his eyes were warmed and softened. “Will you have a drink,

Lee?”
“I’m nipping at the og-ka-py in the kitchen,” said Lee and went back to the house.
Samuel leaned down and gathered up one of the boys and held him on his lap. “Take that one
up,” he said to Adam. “We ought to see whether there’s some-thing that draws names to them.”
Adam held the other child awkwardly on his knee. “They look some alike,” he said, “but not
when you look close. This one has rounder eyes than that one.”
“Yes, and a rounder head and bigger ears,” Samuel added. “But this one is more like—like a
bullet. This one might go farther but not so high. And this one is going to be darker in the hair
and skin. This one will be shrewd, I think, and shrewdness is a limitation on the mind.
Shrewdness tells you what you must not do because it would not be shrewd. See how this one
supports himself! He’s farther along than that one—better developed. Isn’t it strange how
different they are when you look close?”
Adam’s face was changing as though he had opened and come out on his surface. He held up his
finger, and the child made a lunge for it and missed and nearly fell off his lap. “Whoa!” said
Adam. “Take it easy. Do you want to fall?”
“It would be a mistake to name them for qualities we think they have,” Samuel said. “We might
be wrong—so wrong. Maybe it would be good to give them a high mark to shoot at—a name to
live up to. The man I’m named for had his name called clear by the Lord God, and I’ve been
listening all my life. And once or twice I’ve thought I heard my name called—but not clear, not
clear.”
Adam, holding the child by his upper arm, leaned over and poured whisky in both glasses. “I
thank you for coming, Samuel,” he said. “I even thank you for hitting me. That’s a strange thing
to say.”
“It was a strange thing for me to do. Liza will never believe it, and so I’ll never tell her. An
unbelieved truth can hurt a man much more than a lie. It takes great courage to back truth
unacceptable to our times. There’s a punishment for it, and it’s usually crucifixion. I haven’t the
courage for that.”
Adam said, “I’ve wondered why a man of your knowledge would work a desert hill place.”
“It’s because I haven’t courage,” said Samuel. “I could never quite take the responsibility. When
the Lord God did not call my name, I might have called His name—but I did not. There you have
the differ-ence between greatness and mediocrity. It’s not an un-common disease. But it’s nice
for a mediocre man to know that greatness must be the loneliest state in the world.”
“I’d think there are degrees of greatness,” Adam said.
“I don’t think so,” said Samuel. “That would be like saying there is a little bigness. No. I believe
when you come to that responsibility the hugeness and you are alone to make your choice. On
one side you have warmth and companionship and sweet understanding, and on the other—cold,
lonely greatness. There you make your choice. I’m glad I chose mediocrity, but how am I to say
what reward might have come with the other? None of my children will be great either, except
perhaps Tom. He’s suffering over the choosing right now. It’s a painful thing to watch. And
somewhere in me I want him to say yes. Isn’t that strange? A father to want his son condemned to

greatness! What selfish-ness that must be.”
Adam chuckled. “This naming is no simple business, I see.”
“Did you think it would be?”
“I didn’t know it could be so pleasant,” said Adam.
Lee came out with a platter of fried chicken, a bowl of smoking boiled potatoes, and a deep dish
of pickled beets, all carried on a pastry board. “I don’t know how good it will be,” he said. “The
hens are a little old. We don’t have any pullets. The weasels got the baby chicks this year.”
“Pull up,” said Samuel.
“Wait until I get my ng-ka-py,” said Lee.
While he was gone Adam said, “It’s strange to me—he used to speak differently.”
“He trusts you now,” Samuel said. “He has a gift of resigned loyalty without -hope of reward.
He’s maybe a much better man than either of us could dream of being.”
Lee came back and took his seat at the end of the table. “Just put the boys on the ground,” he said.
The twins protested when they were set down. Lee spoke to them sharply in Cantonese and they
were silent.
The men ate quietly as nearly all country people do. Suddenly Lee got up and hurried into the
house. He came back with a jug of red wine. “I forgot it,” he said. “I found it in the house.”
Adam laughed. “I remember drinking wine here be-fore I bought the place. Maybe I bought the
place because of the wine. The chicken’s good, Lee. I don’t think I’ve been aware of the taste of
food for a long time.”
“You’re getting well,” Samuel said. “Some people think it’s an insult to the glory of their
sickness to get well. But the time poultice is no respecter of glories. Everyone gets well if he
waits around.”

4
Lee cleared the table and gave each of the boys a clean drumstick. They sat solemnly holding
their greasy batons and alternately inspecting and sucking them. The wine and the glasses stayed
on the table.
“We’d best get on with the naming,” Samuel said. “I can feel a little tightening on my halter from
Liza.”
“I can’t think what to name them,” Adam said.
“You have no family name you want—no inviting trap for a rich relative, no proud name to recreate?”
“No, I’d like them to start fresh, insofar as that is possible.”
Samuel knocked his forehead with his knuckles. “What a shame,” he said. “What a shame it is
that the proper names for them they cannot have.”
“What do you mean?” Adam asked.
“Freshness, you said. I thought last night—” He paused. “Have you thought of your own name?”
“Mine?”
“Of course. Your first-born—Cain and Abel.”

Adam said, “Oh, no. No, we can’t do that.”
“I know we can’t. That would be tempting whatever fate there is. But isn’t it odd that Cain is
maybe the best-known name in the whole world and as far as I know only one man has ever
borne it?”
Lee said, “Maybe that’s why the name has never changed its emphasis.”
Adam looked into the ink-red wine in his glass. “I got a shiver when you mentioned it,” he said.
“Two stories have haunted us and followed us from our beginning,” Samuel said. “We carry them
along with us like invisible tails—the story of original sin and the story of Cain and Abel. And I
don’t understand either of them. I don’t understand them at all but I feel them. Liza gets angry
with me. She says I should not try to understand them. She says why should we try to explain a
verity. Maybe she’s right—maybe she’s right. Lee, Liza says you’re a Presbyterian—do you
under-stand the Garden of Eden and Cain and Abel?”
“She thought I should be something, and I went to Sunday School long ago in San Francisco.
People like you to be something, preferably what they are.”
Adam said, “He asked you if you understood.”
“I think I understand the Fall. I could perhaps feel that in myself. But the brother murder—no.
Well, maybe I don’t remember the details very well.”
Samuel said, “Most people don’t read the details. It’s the details that astonish me. And Abel had
no chil-dren.” He looked up at the sky. “Lord, how the day passes! It’s like a life—so quickly
when we don’t watch it and so slowly when we do. No,” he said, “I’m having enjoyment. And I
made a promise to myself that I would not consider enjoyment a sin. I take a pleasure in inquiring
into things. I’ve never been content to pass a stone without looking under it. And it is a black
disappointment to me that I can never see the far side of the moon.”
“I don’t have a Bible,” Adam said. “I left the family one in Connecticut.”
“I have,” said Lee. “I’ll get it.”
“No need,” said Samuel. “Liza let me take her moth-er’s. It’s here in my pocket.” He took out the
package and unwrapped the battered book. “This one has been scraped and gnawed at,” he said.
“I wonder what agon-ies have settled here. Give me a used Bible and I will, I think, be able to tell
you about a man by the places that are edged with the dirt of seeking fingers. Liza wears a Bible
down evenly. Here we are—this oldest story. If it troubles us it must be that we find the trouble in
ourselves.”
“I haven’t heard it since I was a child,” said Adam.
“You think it’s long then, and it’s very short,” said Samuel. “I’ll read it through and then we’ll go
back. Give me a little wine, my throat’s dried out with wine. Here it is—such a little story to have
made so deep a wound.” He looked down at the ground. “See!” he said. “The boys have gone to
their sleep, there in the dust.”
Lee got up. “I’ll cover them,” he said.
“The dust is warm,” said Samuel. “Now it goes this way. ‘And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she
con-ceived, and bare Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man from the Lord.” ’ ”
Adam started to speak and Samuel looked up at him and he was silent and covered his eyes with

his hand. Samuel read, “ ‘And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep,
but Cain was a tiller of the ground. And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought
of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of
his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering. But unto
Cain and to his offering he had not respect.’ ”
Lee said, “Now there—no, go on, go on. We’ll come back.”
Samuel read, “ ‘And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the Lord said unto Cain,
“Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and
thou shalt rule over him.”
“ ‘And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that
Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him. And the Lord said unto Cain, “Where is Abel
thy brother?” And he said, “I know not. Am I my brother’s keeper?” And he said, “What hast
thou done? The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now art thou
cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand.
When thou tillest the ground it shall not hence-forth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a
vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.” And Cain said unto the Lord, “My punishment is greater
than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy
face shall I be hid. And I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass
that everyone that findeth me shall slay me.” And the Lord said unto him, “Therefore whosoever
slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the Lord set a mark upon Cain,
lest any finding him should kill him. And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt
in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.’ ”
Samuel closed the loose cover of the book almost with weariness. “There it is,” he said. “Sixteen
verses, no more. And oh, Lord! I had forgotten how dreadful it is—no single tone of
encouragement. Maybe Liza’s right. There’s nothing to understand.”
Adam sighed deeply. “It’s not a comforting story, is it?”
Lee poured a tumbler full of dark liquor from his round stone bottle and sipped it and opened his
mouth to get the double taste on the back of his tongue. “No story has power, nor will it last,
unless we feel in ourselves that it is true and true of us. What a great burden of guilt men have!”
Samuel said to Adam, “And you have tried to take it all.”
Lee said, “So do I, so does everyone. We gather our arms full of guilt as though it were precious
stuff. It must be that we want it that way.”
Aron broke in, “It makes me feel better, not worse.”
“How do you mean?” Samuel asked.
“Well, every little boy thinks he invented sin. Virtue we think we learn, because we are told about
it. But sin is our own designing.”
“Yes, I see. But how does this story make it better?”
“Because,” Adam said excitedly, “we are descended from this. This is our father. Some of our
guilt is absorbed in our ancestry. What chance did we have? We are the children of our father. It

means we aren’t the first. It’s an excuse, and there aren’t enough excuses in the world.”
“Not convincing ones anyway,” said Lee. “Else we would long ago have wiped out guilt, and the
world would not be filled with sad, punished people.”
Samuel said, “But do you think of another frame to this picture? Excuse or not, we are snapped
back to our ancestry. We have guilt.”
Adam said, “I remember being a little outraged at God. Both Cain and Abel gave what they had,
and God accepted Abel and rejected Cain. I never thought that was a just thing. I never
understood it. Do you?”
“Maybe we think out of a different background,” said Lee. “I remember that this story was
written by and for a shepherd people. They were not farmers. Wouldn’t the god of shepherds find
a fat lamb more valuable than a sheaf of barley? A sacrifice must be the best and most valuable.”
“Yes, I can see that,” said Samuel. “And Lee, let me caution you about bringing your Oriental
reasoning to Liza’s attention.”
Adam was excited. “Yes, but why did God condemn Cain? That’s an injustice.”
Samuel said, “There’s an advantage to listening to the words. God did not condemn Cain at all.
Even God can have a preference, can’t he? Let’s suppose God liked lamb better than vegetables. I
think I do myself. Cain brought him a bunch of carrots maybe. And God said, ‘I don’t like this.
Try again. Bring me something I like and I’ll set you up alongside your brother.’ But Cain got
mad. His feelings were hurt. And when a man’s feelings are hurt he wants to strike at something,
and Abel was in the way of his anger.”
Lee said, “St. Paul says to the Hebrews that Abel had faith.”
“There’s no reference to it in Genesis,” Samuel said. “No faith or lack of faith. Only a hint of
Cain’s tem-per.”
Lee asked, “How does Mrs. Hamilton feel about the paradoxes of the Bible?”
“Why, she does not feel anything because she does not admit they are there.”
“But—”
“Hush, man. Ask her. And you’ll come out of it older but not less confused.”
Adam said, “You two have studied this. I only got it through my skin and not much of it stuck.
Then Cain was driven out for murder?”
“That’s right—for murder.”
“And God branded him?”
“Did you listen? Cain bore the mark not to destroy him but to save him. And there’s a curse
called down on any man who shall kill him. It was a preserving mark.”
Adam said, “I can’t get over a feeling that Cain got the dirty end of the stick.”
“Maybe he did,” said Samuel. “But Cain lived and had children, and Abel lives only in the story.
We are Cain’s children. And isn’t it strange that three grown men, here in a century so many
thousands of years away, discuss this crime as though it happened in King City yesterday and
hadn’t come up for trial?”
One of the twins awakened and yawned and looked at Lee and went to sleep again.
Lee said, “Remember, Mr. Hamilton, I told you I was trying to translate some old Chinese poetry

into English? No, don’t worry. I won’t read it. Doing it, I found some of the old things as fresh
and clear as this morning. And I wondered why. And, of course, people are interested only in
themselves. If a story is not about the hearer he will not listen. And I here make a rule—a great
and lasting story is about everyone or it will not last. The strange and foreign is not interesting—
only the deeply personal and familiar.”
Samuel said, “Apply that to the Cain-Abel story.”
And Adam said, “I didn’t kill my brother—” Sud-denly he stopped and his mind went reeling
back in time.
“I think I can,” Lee answered Samuel. “I think this is the best-known story in the world because it
is every-body’s story. I think it is the symbol story of the human soul. I’m feeling my way now—
don’t jump on me if I’m not clear. The greatest terror a child can have is that he is not loved, and
rejection is the hell he fears. I think everyone in the world to a large or small extent has felt
rejection. And with rejection comes anger, and with anger some kind of crime in revenge for the
rejection, and with the crime guilt—and there is the story of mankind. I think that if rejection
could be amputated, the human would not be what he is. Maybe there would be fewer crazy
people. I am sure in myself there would not be many jails. It is all there—the start, the beginning.
One child, refused the love he craves, kicks the cat and hides his secret guilt; and another steals
so that money will make him loved; and a third conquers the world—and always the guilt and
revenge and more guilt. The human is the only guilty animal. Now wait! Therefore I think this
old and terrible story is important because it is a chart of the soul—the secret, rejected, guilty
soul. Mr. Trask, you said you did not kill your brother and then you remembered something. I
don’t want to know what it was, but was it very far apart from Cain and Abel? And what do you
think of my Oriental patter, Mr. Hamilton? You know I am no more Oriental than you are.”
Samuel had leaned his elbows on the table and his hands covered his eyes and his forehead. “I
want to think,” he said. “Damn you, I want to think. I’ll want to take this off alone where I can
pick it apart and see. Maybe you’ve tumbled a world for me. And I don’t know what I can build
in my world’s place.”
Lee said softly, “Couldn’t a world be built around accepted truth? Couldn’t some pains and
insanities be rooted out if the causes were known?”
“I don’t know, damn you. You’ve disturbed my pretty universe. You’ve taken a contentious game
and made an answer of it. Let me alone—let me think! Your damned bitch is having pups in my
brain already. Oh, I wonder what my Tom will think of this! He’ll cradle it in the palm of his
mind. He’ll turn it slow in his brain like a roast of pork before the fire. Adam, come out now.
You’ve been long enough in whatever memory it was.”
Adam started. He sighed deeply. “Isn’t it too sim-ple?” he asked. “I’m always afraid of simple
things.”
“It isn’t simple at all,” said Lee. “It’s desperately complicated. But at the end there’s light.”
“There’s not going to be light long,” Samuel said. “We’ve sat and let the evening come. I drove
over to help name the twins and they’re not named. We’ve swung ourselves on a pole. Lee, you
better keep your complications out of the machinery of the set-up churches or there might be a

Chinese with nails in his hands and feet. They like complications but they like their own. I’ll have
to be driving home.”
Adam said desperately, “Name me some names.”
“From the Bible?”
“From anyplace.”
“Well, let’s see. Of all the people who started out of Egypt only two came to the Promised Land.
Would you like them for a symbol?”
“Who?”
“Caleb and Joshua.”
“Joshua was a soldier—a general. I don’t like sol-diering.”
“Well, Caleb was a captain.”
“But not a general. I kind of like Caleb—Caleb Trask.”
One of the twins woke up and without interval began to wail.
“You called his name,” said Samuel. “You don’t like Joshua, and Caleb’s named. He’s the smart
one—the dark one. See, the other one is awake too. Well, Aaron I’ve always liked, but he didn’t
make it to the Promised Land.”
The second boy almost joyfully began to cry.
“That’s good enough,” said Adam.
Suddenly Samuel laughed. “In two minutes,” he said, “and after a waterfall of words. Caleb and
Aaron—now you are people and you have joined the fraternity and you have the right to be
damned.”
Lee took the boys up under his arms. “Have you got them straight?” he asked.
“Of course,” said Adam. “That one is Caleb and you are Aaron.”
Lee lugged the yelling twins toward the house in the dusk.
“Yesterday I couldn’t tell them apart,” said Adam. “Aaron and Caleb.”
“Thank the good Lord we had produce from our patient thought,” Samuel said. “Liza would have
pre-ferred Joshua. She loves the crashing walls of Jericho. But she likes Aaron too, so I guess it’s
all right. I’ll go and hitch up my rig.”
Adam walked to the shed with him. “I’m glad you came,” he said. “There’s a weight off me.”
Samuel slipped the bit in Doxology’s reluctant mouth, set the brow band, and buckled the
throatlatch. “Maybe you’ll now be thinking of the garden in the flat land,” he said. “I can see it
there the way you planned it.”
Adam was long in answering. At last he said, “I think that kind of energy is gone out of me. I
can’t feel the pull of it. I have money enough to live. I never wanted it for myself. I have no one
to show a garden to.”
Samuel wheeled on him and his eyes were filled with tears. “Don’t think it will ever die,” he
cried. “Don’t expect it. Are you better than other men? I tell you it won’t ever die until you do.”
He stood panting for a moment and then he climbed into the rig and whipped Doxology and he
drove away, his shoulders hunched, without saying good-by.

PART THREE

Chapter 23
1
The Hamiltons were strange, high-strung people, and some of them were tuned too high and they
snapped. This happens often in the world.
Of all his daughters Una was Samuel’s greatest joy. Even as a little girl she hungered for learning
as a child does for cookies in the late afternoon. Una and her father had a conspiracy about
learning—secret books were borrowed and read and their secrets communi-cated privately.
Of all the children Una had the least humor. She met and married an intense dark man—a man
whose fingers were stained with chemicals, mostly silver ni-trate. He was one of those men who
live in poverty so that their lines of questioning may continue. His ques-tion was about
photography. He believed that the ex-terior world could be transferred to paper—not in the ghost
shadings of black and white but in the colors the human eye perceives.
His name was Anderson and he had little gift for communication. Like most technicians, he had a
terror and a contempt for speculation. The inductive leap was not for him. He dug a step and
pulled himself up one single step, the way a man climbs the last shoulder of a mountain. He had
great contempt, born of fear, for the Hamiltons, for they all half believed they had wings—and
they got some bad falls that way.
Anderson never fell, never slipped back, never flew. His steps moved slowly, slowly upward, and
in the end, it is said, he found what he wanted—color film. He married Una, perhaps, because she
had little humor, and this reassured him. And because her family fright-ened and embarrassed
him, he took her away to the north, and it was black and lost where he went—somewhere on the
borders of Oregon. He must have lived a very primitive life with his bottles and papers.
Una wrote bleak letters without joy but also without self-pity. She was well and she hoped her
family was well. Her husband was near to his discovery.
And then she died and her body was shipped home.
I never knew Una. She was dead before I remember, but George Hamilton told me about it many
years later and his eyes filled with tears and his voice croaked in the telling.
“Una was not a beautiful girl like Mollie,” he said. “But she had the loveliest hands and feet. Her
ankles were as slender as grass and she moved like grass. Her fingers were long and the nails
narrow and shaped like almonds. And Una had lovely skin too, translucent, even glowing.
“She didn’t laugh and play like the rest of us. There was something set apart about her. She
seemed always to be listening. When she was reading, her face would be like the face of one
listening to music. And when we asked her any question, why, she gave the answer, if she knew it
—not pointed up and full of color and ‘maybes’ and ‘it-might-bes’ the way the rest of us would.
We were always full of bull. There was some pure simple thing in Una,” George said.

“And then they brought her home. Her nails were broken to the quick and her fingers cracked and
all worn out. And her poor, dear feet—” George could not go on for a while, and then he said
with the fierceness of a man trying to control himself, “Her feet were broken and gravel-cut and
briar-cut. Her dear feet had not worn shoes for a long time. And her skin was rough as rawhide.
“We think it was an accident,” he said. “So many chemicals around. We think it was.”
But Samuel thought and mourned in the thought that the accident was pain and despair.
Una’s death struck Samuel like a silent earthquake. He said no brave and reassuring words, he
simply sat alone and rocked himself. He felt that it was his neglect had done it.
And now his tissue, which had fought joyously against time, gave up a little. His young skin
turned old, his clear eyes dulled, and a little stoop came to his great shoulders. Liza with her
acceptance could take care of tragedy; she had no real hope this side of Heaven. But Samuel had
put up a laughing wall against natural laws, and Una’s death breached his battlements. He
became an old man.
His other children were doing well. George was in the insurance business. Will was getting rich.
Joe had gone east and was helping to invent a new profession called advertising. Joe’s very faults
were virtues in this field. He found that he could communicate his material daydreaming—and,
properly applied, that is all adver-tising is. Joe was a big man in a new field.
The girls were married, all except Dessie, and she had a successful dressmaking business in
Salinas. Only Tom had never got started.
Samuel told Adam Trask that Tom was arguing with greatness. And the father watched his son
and could feel the drive and the fear, the advance and the retreat, because he could feel it in
himself.
Tom did not have his father’s lyric softness or his gay good looks. But you could feel Tom when
you came near to him—you could feel strength and warmth and an iron integrity. And under all
of this was a shrinking—a shy shrinking. He could be as gay as his father, and suddenly in the
middle it would be cut the way you would cut a violin string, and you could watch Tom go
whirling into darkness.
He was a dark-faced man; his skin, perhaps from sun, was a black red, as though some Norse or
perhaps Vandal blood was perpetuated in him. His hair and beard and mustache were dark red
too, and his eyes gleamed startlingly blue against his coloring. He was powerful, heavy of
shoulders and arm, but his hips were slim. He could lift and run and hike and ride with anyone,
but he had no sense of competition whatever. Will and George were gamblers and often tried to
entice their brother into the joys and sorrows of ven-ture.
Tom said, “I’ve tried and it just seems tiresome. I’ve thought why this must be. I get no great
triumph when I win and no tragedy when I lose. Without these it is meaningless. It is not a way to
make money, that we know, and unless it can simulate birth and death, joy and sorrow, it seems,
at least to me—it feels—it doesn’t feel at all. I would do it if I felt anything—good or bad.”
Will did not understand this. His whole life was competitive and he lived by one kind of
gambling or another. He loved Tom and he tried to give him the things he himself found pleasant.
He took him into business and tried to inoculate him with the joys of buying and selling, of

outwitting other men, of judging them for a bluff, of living by maneuver.
Always Tom came back to the ranch, puzzled, not critical, but feeling that somewhere he had lost
track. He felt that he should take joy in the man-pleasures of contest, but he could not pretend to
himself that he did.
Samuel had said that Tom always took too much on his plate, whether it was beans or women.
And Samuel was wise, but I think he knew only one side of Tom. Maybe Tom opened up a little
more for children. What I set down about him will be the result of memory plus what I know to
be true plus conjecture built on the combination. Who knows whether it will be correct?
We lived in Salinas and we knew when Tom had arrived—I think he always arrived at night—
because under our pillows, Mary’s and mine, there would be packages of gum. And gum was
valuable in those days just as a nickel was valuable. There were months when he did not come,
but every morning as soon as we awakened we put our hands under our pillows to see. And I still
do it, and it has been many years since there has been gum there.
My sister Mary did not want to be a girl. It was a misfortune she could not get used to. She was
an ath-lete, a marble player, a pitcher of one-o’-cat, and the trappings of a girl inhibited her. Of
course this was long before the compensations for being a girl were apparent to her.
Just as we knew that somewhere on our bodies, probably under the arm, there was a button which
if pressed just right would permit us to fly, so Mary had worked out a magic for herself to change
her over into the tough little boy she wanted to be. If she went to sleep in a magical position,
knees crooked just right, head at a magical angle, fingers all crossed one over the other, in the
morning she would be a boy. Every night she tried to find exactly the right combination, but she
never could. I used to help her cross her fingers like shiplap.
She was despairing of ever getting it right when one morning there was gum under the pillow.
We each peeled a stick and solemnly chewed it; it was Beeman’s peppermint, and nothing so
delicious has been made since.
Mary was pulling on her long black ribbed stockings when she said with great relief, “Of course.”
“Of course what?” I asked.
“Uncle Tom,” she said and chewed her gum with great snapping sounds.
“Uncle Tom what?” I demanded.
“He’ll know how to get to be a boy.”
There it was—just as simple as that. I wondered why I hadn’t thought of it myself.
Mother was in the kitchen overseeing a new little Danish girl who worked for us. We had a series
of girls. New-come Danish farm families put their daugh-ters out to service with American
families, and they learned not only English but American cooking and table setting and manners
and all the little niceties of high life in Salinas. At the end of a couple of years of this, at twelve
dollars a month, the girls were highly desirable wives for American boys. Not only did they have
American manners but they could still work like horses in the fields. Some of the most elegant
families in Salinas today are descended from these girls.
It would be flaxen-haired Mathilde in the kitchen, with Mother clucking over her like a hen.
We charged in. “Is he up?”

“Sh!” said Mother. “He got in late. You let him sleep.”
But the water was running in the basin of the back bedroom so we knew he was up. We crouched
like cats at his door, waiting for him to emerge.
There was always a little diffidence between us at first. I think Uncle Tom was as shy as we were.
I think he wanted to come running out and toss us in the air, but instead we were all formal.
“Thank you for the gum, Uncle Tom.”
“I’m glad you liked it.”
“Do you think we’ll have an oyster loaf late at night while you’re here?”
“We’ll certainly try, if your mother will let you.”
We drifted into the sitting room and sat down. Moth-er’s voice called from the kitchen,
“Children, you let him alone.”
“They’re all right, Ollie,” he called back.
We sat in a triangle in the living room. Tom’s face was so dark and his eyes so blue. He wore
good clothes but he never seemed well dressed. In this he was very different from his father. His
red mustache was never neat and his hair would not lie down and his hands were hard from work.
Mary said, “Uncle Tom, how do you get to be a boy?”
“How? Why, Mary, you’re just born a boy.”
“No, that’s not what I mean. How do I get to be a boy?”
Tom studied her gravely. “You?” he asked.
Her words poured out. “I don’t want to be a girl, Uncle Tom. I want to be a boy. A girl’s all
kissing and dolls. I don’t want to be a girl. I don’t want to.” Tears of anger welled up in Mary’s
eyes.
Tom looked down at his hands and picked at a loose piece of callus with a broken nail. He
wanted to say something beautiful, I think. He wished for words like his father’s words, sweet
winged words, cooing and lovely. “I wouldn’t like you to be a boy,” he said.
“Why not?”
“I like you as a girl.”
An idol was crashing in Mary’s temple. “You mean you like girls?”
“Yes, Mary, I like girls very much.”
A look of distaste crossed Mary’s face. If it were true, Tom was a fool. She put on her don’t-giveme-any-of-that-crap tone. “All right,” she said, “but how do I go about being a boy?”
Tom had a good ear. He knew he was reeling down in Mary’s estimation and he wanted her to
love him and to admire him. At the same time there was a fine steel wire of truthfulness in him
that cut off the heads of fast-traveling lies. He looked at Mary’s hair, so light that it was almost
white, and braided tight to be out of the way, and dirty at the end of the braid, for Mary wiped her
hands on her braid before she made a diffi-cult marble shot. Tom studied her cold and hostile
eyes.
“I don’t think you really want to change.”
“I do.”
Tom was wrong—she really did.

“Well,” he said, “you can’t. And someday you’ll be glad.”
“I won’t be glad,” said Mary, and she turned to me and said with frigid contempt, “He doesn’t
know!”
Tom winced and I shivered at the immensity of her criminal charge. Mary was braver and more
ruthless than most. That’s why she won every marble in Salinas.
Tom said uneasily, “If your mother says it’s all right, I’ll order the oyster loaf this morning and
pick it up tonight.”
“I don’t like oyster loaves,” said Mary and stalked to our bedroom and slammed the door.
Tom looked ruefully after her. “She’s a girl all right,” he said.
Now we were alone together and I felt that I had to heal the wound Mary had made. “I love
oyster loaves,” I said.
“Sure you do. So does Mary.”
“Uncle Tom, don’t you think there’s some way for her to be a boy?”
“No, I don’t,” he said sadly. “I would have told her if I had known.”
“She’s the best pitcher in the West End.”
Tom sighed and looked down at his hands again, and I could see his failure on him and I was
sorry for him, aching sorry. I brought out my hollowed cork with pins stuck down to make bars.
“Would you like to have my fly cage, Uncle Tom?”
Oh, he was a great gentleman. “Do you want me to have it?”
“Yes. You see, you pull up a pin to get the fly in and then he sits in there and buzzes.”
“I’d like to have it very much. Thank you, John.”
He worked all day with a sharp tiny pocketknife on a small block of wood, and when we came
home from school he had carved a little face. The eyes and ears and lips were movable, and little
perches connected them with the inside of the hollow head. At the bottom of the neck there was a
hole closed by a cork. And this was very wonderful. You caught a fly and eased him through the
hole and set the cork. And suddenly the head became alive. The eyes moved and the lips talked
and the ears wiggled as the frantic fly crawled over the little perches. Even Mary forgave him a
little, but she never really trusted him until after she was glad she was a girl, and then it was too
late. He gave the head not to me but to us. We still have it put away somewhere, and it still works.
Sometimes Tom took me fishing. We started before the sun came up and drove in the rig straight
toward Frémont’s Peak, and as we neared the mountains the stars would pale out and the light
would rise to blacken the mountains. I can remember riding and pressing my ear and cheek
against Tom’s coat. And I can remember that his arm would rest lightly over my shoulders and
his hand pat my arm occasionally. Finally we would pull up under an oak tree and take the horse
out of the shafts, water him at the stream side, and halter him to the back of the rig.
I don’t remember that Tom talked. Now that I think of it, I can’t remember the sound of his voice
or the kind of words he used. I can remember both about my grandfather, but when I think of
Tom it is a memory of a kind of warm silence. Maybe he didn’t talk at all. Tom had beautiful
tackle and made his own flies. But he didn’t seem to care whether we caught trout or not. He
needed not to triumph over animals.

I remember the five-fingered ferns growing under the little waterfalls, bobbing their green fingers
as the drop-lets struck them. And I remember the smells of the hills, wild azalea and a very
distant skunk and the sweet cloy of lupin and horse sweat on harness. I remember the sweeping
lovely dance of high buzzards against the sky and Tom looking long up at them, but I can’t
remember that he ever said anything about them. I remember holding the bight of a line while
Tom drove pegs and braided a splice. I remember the smell of crushed ferns in the creel and the
delicate sweet odor of fresh damp rainbow trout lying so prettily on the green bed. And finally I
can remember coming back to the rig and pouring rolled barley into the leather feed-bag and
buckling it over the horse’s head behind the ears. And I have no sound of his voice or words in
my ear; he is dark and silent and hugely warm in my memory.
Tom felt his darkness. His father was beautiful and clever, his mother was short and
mathematically sure. Each of his brothers and sisters had looks or gifts or fortune. Tom loved all
of them passionately, but he felt heavy and earth-bound. He climbed ecstatic mountains and
floundered in the rocky darkness between the peaks. He had spurts of bravery but they were
brack-eted in battens of cowardice.
Samuel said that Tom was quavering over greatness, trying to decide whether he could take the
cold respon-sibility. Samuel knew his son’s quality and felt the potential of violence, and it
frightened him, for Samuel had no violence—even when he hit Adam Trask with his fist he had
no violence. And the books that came into the house, some of them secretly—well, Samuel rode
lightly on top of a book and he balanced happily among ideas the way a man rides white rapids in
a canoe. But Tom got into a book, crawled and groveled between the covers, tunneled like a mole
among the thoughts, and came up with the book all over his face and hands.
Violence and shyness—Tom’s loins needed women and at the same time he did not think himself
worthy of a woman. For long periods he would welter in a howling celibacy, and then he would
take a train to San Francisco and roll and wallow in women, and then he would come silently
back to the ranch, feeling weak and unfulfilled and unworthy, and he would punish himself with
work, would plow and plant unprofitable land, would cut tough oakwood until his back was
breaking and his arms were weary rags.
It is probable that his father stood between Tom and the sun, and Samuel’s shadow fell on him.
Tom wrote secret poetry, and in those days it was only sensible to keep it secret. The poets were
pale emasculates, and Western men held them in contempt. Poetry was a symptom of weakness,
of degeneracy and decay. To read it was to court catcalls. To write it was to be suspected and
ostracized. Poetry was a secret vice, and properly so. No one knows whether Tom’s poetry was
any good or not, for he showed it to only one person, and before he died he burned every word.
From the ashes in the stove there must have been a great deal of it.
Of all his family Tom loved Dessie best. She was gay. Laughter lived on her doorstep.
Her shop was a unique institution in Salinas. It was a woman’s world. Here all the rules, and the
fears that created the iron rules, went down. The door was closed to men. It was a sanctuary
where women could be themselves—smelly, wanton, mystic, conceited, truth-ful, and interested.
The whalebone corsets came off at Dessie’s, the sacred corsets that molded and warped woman-

flesh into goddess-flesh. At Dessie’s they were women who went to the toilet and overate and
scratched and farted. And from this freedom came laughter, roars of laughter.
Men could hear the laughter through the closed door and were properly frightened at what was
going on, feeling, perhaps, that they were the butt of the laughter which to a large extent was true.
I can see Dessie now, her gold pince-nez wobbling on a nose not properly bridged for pince-nez,
her eyes streaming with hilarious tears, and her whole front constricted with muscular spasms of
laughter. Her hair would come down and drift between her glasses and her eyes, and the glasses
would fall off her wet nose and spin and swing at the end of their black ribbon.
You had to order a dress from Dessie months in advance, and you made twenty visits to her shop
before you chose material and pattern. Nothing so healthy as Dessie had ever happened to
Salinas. The men had their lodges, their clubs, their whorehouses; the women nothing but the
Altar Guild and the mincing coquetry of the minister until Dessie came along.
And then Dessie fell in love. I do not know any details of her love affair—who the man was or
what the circumstances, whether it was religion or a living wife, a disease or a selfishness. I guess
my mother knew, but it was one of those things put away in the family closet and never brought
out. And if other people in Salinas knew, they must have kept it a loyal town secret. All I do
know is that it was a hopeless thing, gray and terrible. After a year of it the joy was all drained
out of Dessie and the laughter had ceased.
Tom raged crazily through the hills like a lion in horrible pain. In the middle of a night he
saddled and rode away, not waiting for the morning train, to Salinas. Samuel followed him and
sent a telegram from King City to Salinas.
And when in the morning Tom, his face black, spurred his spent horse up John Street in Salinas,
the sheriff was waiting for him. He disarmed Tom and put him in a cell and fed him black coffee
and brandy until Samuel came for him.
Samuel did not lecture Tom. He took him home and never mentioned the incident. And a stillness
fell on the Hamilton place.

2
On Thanksgiving of 1911 the family gathered at the ranch—all the children except Joe, who was
in New York, and Lizzie, who had left the family and joined another, and Una, who was dead.
They arrived with presents and more food than even this clan could eat. They were all married
save Dessie and Tom. Their children filled the Hamilton place with riot. The home place flared up
—noisier than it had ever been. The children cried and screamed and fought. The men made
many trips to the forge and came back self-consciously wiping their mustaches.
Liza’s little round face grew redder and redder. She organized and ordered. The kitchen stove
never went out. The beds were full, and comforters laid on pillows on the floor were for children.
Samuel dug up his old gaiety. His sardonic mind glowed and his speech took on its old singing
rhythm. He hung on with the talk and the singing and the memories, and then suddenly, and it not
midnight, he tired. Weariness came down on him, and he went to his bed where Liza had been for
two hours. He was puz-zled at himself, not that he had to go to bed but that he wanted to.

When the mother and father were gone, Will brought the whisky in from the forge and the clan
had a meet-ing in the kitchen with whisky passed around in round-bottomed jelly glasses. The
mothers crept to the bedrooms to see that the children were covered and then came back. They all
spoke softly, not to disturb the children and the old people. There were Tom and Dessie, George
and his pretty Mamie, who had been a Dempsey, Mollie and William J. Martin, Olive and Ernest
Steinbeck, Will and his Deila.
They all wanted to say the same thing—all ten of them. Samuel was ah old man. It was as
startling a discovery as the sudden seeing of a ghost. Somehow they had not believed it could
happen. They drank their whisky and talked softly of the new thought.
His shoulders—did you see how they slump? And there’s no spring in his step.
His toes drag a little, but it’s not that—it’s in his eyes. His eyes are old.
He never would go to bed until last.
Did you notice he forgot what he was saying right in the middle of a story?
It’s his skin told me. It’s gone wrinkled, and the backs of his hands have turned transparent.
He favors his right leg.
Yes, but that’s the one the horse broke.
I know, but he never favored it before.
They said these things in outrage. This can’t happen, they were saying. Father can’t be an old
man. Samuel is young as the dawn—the perpetual dawn.
He might get old as midday maybe, but sweet God! the evening cannot come, and the night—?
Sweet God, no!
It was natural that their minds leaped on and recoiled, and they would not speak of that, but their
minds said, There can’t be any world without Samuel.
How could we think about anything without knowing what he thought about it?
What would the spring be like, or Christmas, or rain? There couldn’t be a Christmas.
Their minds shrank away from such thinking and they looked for a victim—someone to hurt
because they were hurt. They turned on Tom.
You were here. You’ve been here all along!
How did this happen? When did it happen?
Who did this to him?
Have you by any chance done this with your craziness?
And Tom could stand it because he had been with it. “It was Una,” he said hoarsely. “He couldn’t
get over Una. He told me how a man, a real man, had no right to let sorrow destroy him. He told
me again and again how I must believe that time would take care of it. He said it so often that I
knew he was losing.”
“Why didn’t you tell us? Maybe we could have done something.”
Tom leaped up, violent and cringing. “Goddam it! What was there to tell? That he was dying of
sorrow? That the marrow had melted out of his bones? What was there to tell? You weren’t here.
I had to look at it and see his eyes die down—goddam it.” Tom went out of the room and they
heard his clodhopper feet knock-ing on the flinty ground outside.

They were ashamed. Will Martin said, “I’ll go out and bring him back.”
“Don’t do it,” George said quickly, and the blood kin nodded. “Don’t do it. Let him alone. We
know him from the insides of ourselves.”
In a little while Tom came back. “I want to apolo-gize,” he said. “I’m very sorry. Maybe I’m a
little drunk. Father calls it ‘jolly’ when I do it. One night I rode home”—it was a confession
—”and I came stag-gering across the yard and I fell into the rosebush and crawled up the stairs on
my hands and knees and I was sick on the floor beside my bed. In the morning I tried to tell him I
was sorry, and do you know what he said? ‘Why, Tom, you were just jolly.’ ‘Jolly,’ if I did it. A
drunken man didn’t crawl home. Just jolly.”
George stopped the crazy flow of talk. “We want to apologize to you, Tom,” he said. “Why, we
sounded as though we were blaming you and we didn’t mean to. Or maybe we did mean to. And
we’re sorry.”
Will Martin said realistically, “It’s too hard a life here. Why don’t we get him to sell out and
move to town? He could have a long and happy life. Mollie and I would like them to come and
live with us.”
“I don’t think he’d do it,” said Will. “He’s stubborn as a mule and proud as a horse. He’s got a
pride like brass.”
Olive’s husband, Ernest, said, “Well, there’d be no harm in asking him. We would like to have
him—or both of them—with us.”
Then they were silent again, for the idea of not having the ranch, the dry, stony desert of
heartbreaking hillside and unprofitable hollow, was shocking to them.
Will Hamilton from instinct and training in business had become a fine reader of the less
profound impulses of men and women. He said, “If we ask him to close up shop it will be like
asking him to close his life, and he won’t do it.”
“You’re right, Will,” George agreed. “He would think it was like quitting. He’d feel it was a
cowardice. No, he will never sell out, and if he did I don’t think he would live a week.”
Will said, “There’s another way. Maybe he could come for a visit. Tom can run the ranch. It’s
time Father and Mother saw something of the world. All kinds of things are happening. It would
freshen him, and then he could come back and go to work again. And after a while maybe he
wouldn’t have to. He says himself that thing about time doing the job dynamite can’t touch.”
Dessie brushed the hair out of her eyes. “I wonder if you really think he’s that stupid,” she said.
And Will said out of his experience, “Sometimes a man wants to be stupid if it lets him do a thing
his cleverness forbids. We can try it anyway. What do you all think?”
There was a nodding of heads in the kitchen, and only Tom sat rocklike and brooding.
“Tom, wouldn’t you be willing to take over the ranch?” George asked.
“Oh, that’s nothing,” said Tom. “It’s no trouble to run the ranch because the ranch doesn’t run—
never has.”
“Then why don’t you agree?”
“I’d find a reluctance to insult my father,” Tom said. “He’d know.”
“But where’s the harm in suggesting it?”

Tom rubbed his ears until he forced the blood out of them and for a moment they were white. “I
don’t forbid you,” he said. “But I can’t do it.”
George said, “We could write it in a letter—a kind of invitation, full of jokes. And when he got
tired of one of us, why, he could go to another. There’s years of visiting among the lot of us.”
And that was how they left it.

3
Tom brought Olive’s letter from King City, and because he knew what it contained he waited
until he caught Samuel alone before he gave it to him. Samuel was working in the forge and his
hands were black. He took the envelope by a tiny corner and put it on the anvil, and then he
scrubbed his hands in the half-barrel of black water into which he plunged hot iron. He slit the
letter open with the point of a horseshoe nail and went into the sunlight to read it. Tom had the
wheels off the buckboard and was buttering the axles with yellow axle grease. He watched his
father from the corners of his eyes.
Samuel finished the letter and folded it and put it back in its envelope. He sat down on the bench
in front of the shop and stared into space. Then he opened the letter and read it again and folded it
again and put it in his blue shirt pocket. Then Tom saw him stand up and walk slowly up the
eastern hill, kicking at the flints on the ground.
There had been a little rain and a fuzz of miserly grass had started up. Halfway up the hill Samuel
squatted down and took up a handful of the harsh gravelly earth in his palm and spread it with his
forefin-ger, flint and sandstone and bits of shining mica and a frail rootlet and a veined stone. He
let it slip from his hand and brushed his palms. He picked a spear of grass and set it between his
teeth and stared up the hill to the sky. A gray nervous cloud was scurrying eastward, searching
for trees on which to rain.
Samuel stood up and sauntered down the hill. He looked into the tool shed and patted the four-byfour supports. He paused near Tom and spun one of the free-running wheels of the buckboard,
and he inspected Tom as though he saw him for the first time. “Why, you’re a grown-up man,” he
said.
“Didn’t you know?”
“I guess I did—I guess I did,” said Samuel and sauntered on. There was the sardonic look on his
face his family knew so well—the joke on himself that made him laugh inwardly. He walked by
the sad little garden and all around the house—not a new house any more. Even the last added
lean-to bedrooms were old and weathered and the putty around the windowpanes had shrunk
away from the glass. At the porch he turned and surveyed the whole home cup of the ranch
before he went inside.
Liza was rolling out pie crust on the floury board. She was so expert with the rolling pin that the
dough seemed alive. It flattened out and then pulled back a little from tension in itself. Liza lifted
the pale sheet of it and laid it over one of the pie tins and trimmed the edges with a knife. The
prepared berries lay deep in red juice in a bowl.
Samuel sat down in a kitchen chair and crossed his legs and looked at her. His eyes were smiling.

“Can’t you find something to do this time of day?” she asked.
“Oh, I guess I could, Mother, if I wanted to.”
“Well, don’t sit there and make me nervous. The paper’s in the other room if you’re feeling daylazy.”
“I’ve read it,” said Samuel.
“All of it?”
“All I want to.”
“Samuel, what’s the matter with you? You’re up to something. I can see it in your face. Now tell
it, and let me get on with my pies.”
He swung his leg and smiled at her. “Such a little bit of a wife,” he said. “Three of her is hardly a
bite.”
“Samuel, now you stop this. I don’t mind a joke in the evening sometimes, but it’s not eleven
o’clock. Now you go along.”
Samuel said, “Liza, do you know the meaning of the English word ‘vacation’?”
“Now don’t you make jokes in the morning.”
“Do you, Liza?”
“Of course I do. Don’t play me for a fool.”
“What does it mean?”
“Going away for a rest to the sea and the beach. Now, Samuel, get out with your fooling.”
“I wonder how you know the word.”
“Will you tell me what you’re after? Why shouldn’t I know?”
“Did you ever have one, Liza?”
“Why, I—” She stopped.
“In fifty years, did you ever have a vacation, you little, silly, half-pint, smidgin of a wife?”
“Samuel, please go out of my kitchen,” she said apprehensively.
He took the letter from his pocket and unfolded it. “It’s from Ollie,” he said. “She wants us to
come and visit in Salinas. They’ve fixed over the upstairs rooms. She wants us to get to know the
children. She’s got us tickets for the Chautauqua season. Billy Sunday’s going to wrestle with the
Devil and Bryan is going to make his Cross of Gold speech. I’d like to hear that. It’s an old fool
of a speech but they say he gives it in a way to break your heart.”
Liza rubbed her nose and floured it with her finger. “Is it very costly?” she asked anxiously.
“Costly? Ollie has bought the tickets. They’re a present.”
“We can’t go,” said Liza. “Who’d run the ranch?”
“Tom would—what running there is to do in the winter.”
“He’d be lonely.”
“George would maybe come out and stay a while to go quail hunting. See what’s in the letter,
Liza.”
“What are those?”
“Two tickets to Salinas on the train. Ollie says she doesn’t want to give us a single escape.”
“You can just turn them in and send her back the money.”

“No, I can’t. Why, Liza—Mother—now don’t. Here—here’s a handkerchief.”
“That’s a dish towel,” said Liza.
“Sit here, Mother. There! I guess the shock of taking a rest kind of threw you. Here! I know it’s a
dish towel. They say that Billy Sunday drives the Devil all over the stage.”
“That’s a blasphemy,” said Liza.
“But I’d like to see it, wouldn’t you? What did you say? Hold up your head. I didn’t hear you.
What did you say?”
“I said yes,” said Liza.
Tom was making a drawing when Samuel came in to him. Tom looked at his father with veiled
eyes, trying to read the effect of Olive’s letter.
Samuel looked at the drawing. “What is it?”
“I’m trying to work out a gate-opener so a man won’t have to get out of his rig. Here’s the pullrod to open the latch.”
“What’s going to open it?”
“I figured a strong spring.”
Samuel studied the drawing. “Then what’s going to close it?”
“This bar here. It would slip to this spring with the tension the other way.”
“I see,” said Samuel. “It might work too, if the gate was truly hung. And it would only take twice
as much time to make and keep up as twenty years of getting out of the rig and opening the gate.”
Tom protested, “Sometimes with a skittish horse—”
“I know,” said his father. “But the main reason is that it’s fun.”
Tom grinned. “Caught me,” he said.
“Tom, do you think you could look after the ranch if your mother and I took a little trip?”
“Why, sure,” said Tom. “Where do you plan to go?”
“Ollie wants us to stay with her for a while in Salinas.”
“Why, that would be fine,” said Tom. “Is Mother agreeable?”
“She is, always forgetting the expense.”
“That’s fine,” said Tom. “How long do you plan to be gone?”
Samuel’s jeweled, sardonic eyes dwelt on Tom’s face until Tom said, “What’s the matter,
Father?”
“It’s the little tone, son—so little that I could barely hear it. But it was there. Tom, my son, if you
have a secret with your brothers and sisters, I don’t mind. I think that’s good.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” said Tom.
“You may thank God you didn’t want to be an actor, Tom, because you would have been a very
bad one. You worked it out at Thanksgiving, I guess, when you were all together. And it’s
working smooth as butter. I see Will’s hand in this. Don’t tell me if you don’t want to.”
“I wasn’t in favor of it,” said Tom.
“It doesn’t sound like you,” his father said. “You’d be for scattering the truth out in the sun for
me to see. Don’t tell the others I know.” He turned away and then came back and put his hand on
Tom’s shoulder. “Thank you for wanting to honor me with the truth, my son. It’s not clever but

it’s more permanent.”
“I’m glad you’re going.”
Samuel stood in the doorway of the forge and looked at the land. “They say a mother loves best
an ugly child,” he said, and he shook his head sharply. “Tom, I’ll trade you honor for honor. You
will please hold this in your dark secret place, nor tell any of your brothers and sisters—I know
why I’m going—and, Tom, I know where I’m going, and I am content.”

Chapter 24
1
I have wondered why it is that some people are less affected and torn by the verities of life and
death than others. Una’s death cut the earth from under Samuel’s feet and opened his defended
keep and let in old age. On the other hand Liza, who surely loved her family as deeply as did her
husband, was not destroyed or warped. Her life continued evenly. She felt sorrow but she
survived it.
I think perhaps Liza accepted the world as she ac-cepted the Bible, with all of its paradoxes and
its reverses. She did not like death but she knew it existed, and when it came it did not surprise
her.
Samuel may have thought and played and philoso-phized about death, hut he did not really
believe in it. His world did not have death as a member. He, and all around him, was immortal.
When real death came it was an outrage, a denial of the immortality he deeply felt, and the one
crack in his wall caused the whole structure to crash. I think he had always thought he could
argue himself out of death. It was a personal opponent and one he could lick.
To Liza it was simply death—the thing promised and expected. She could go on and in her
sorrow put a pot of beans in the oven, bake six pies, and plan to exactness how much food would
be necessary properly to feed the funeral guests. And she could in her sorrow see that Samuel had
a clean white shirt and that his black broadcloth was brushed and free of spots and his shoes
blacked. Perhaps it takes these two kinds to make a good marriage, riveted with several kinds of
strengths.
Once Samuel accepted, he could probably go farther than Liza, but the process of accepting tore
him to pieces. Liza watched him closely after the decision to go to Salinas. She didn’t quite know
what he was up to but, like a good and cautious mother, she knew he was up to something. She
was a complete realist. Every-thing else being equal, she was glad to be going to visit her
children. She was curious about them and their children. She had no love of places. A place was
only a resting stage on the way to Heaven. She did not like work for itself, but she did it because
it was there to be done. And she was tired. Increasingly it was more difficult to fight the aches
and stiffnesses which tried to keep her in bed in the morning—not that they ever succeeded.
And she looked forward to Heaven as a place where clothes did not get dirty and where food did
not have to be cooked and dishes washed. Privately there were some things in Heaven of which
she did not quite approve. There was too much singing, and she didn’t see how even the Elect
could survive for very long the celestial laziness which was promised. She would find something
to do in Heaven. There must be something to take up one’s time—some clouds to darn, some
weary wings to rub with liniment. Maybe the collars of the robes needed turning now and then,

and when you come right down to it, she couldn’t believe that even in Heaven there would not be
cobwebs in some corner to be knocked down with a cloth-covered broom.
She was gay and frightened about the visit to Salinas. She liked the idea so well that she felt there
must be something bordering on sin involved in it. And the Chautauqua? Well, she didn’t have to
go and probably wouldn’t. Samuel would run wild—she would have to watch him. She never lost
her feeling that he was young and helpless. It was a good thing that she did not know what went
on in his mind, and, through his mind, what happened to his body.
Places were very important to Samuel. The ranch was a relative, and when he left it he plunged a
knife into a darling. But having made up his mind, Samuel set about doing it well. He made
formal calls on all of his neighbors, the old-timers who remembered how it used to be and how it
was. And when he drove away from his old friends they knew they would not see him again,
although he did not say it. He took to gazing at the mountains and the trees, even at faces, as
though to memorize them for eternity.
He saved his visit to the Trask place for last. He had not been there for months. Adam was not a
young man any more. The boys were eleven years old, and Lee—well, Lee did not change much.
Lee walked to the shed with Samuel.
“I’ve wanted to talk to you for a long time,” said Lee. “But there’s so much to do. And I try to get
to San Francisco at least once a month.”
“You know how it is,” Samuel said. “When you know a friend is there you do not go to see him.
Then he’s gone and you blast your conscience to shreds that you did not see him.”
“I heard about your daughter. I’m sorry.”
“I got your letter, Lee. I have it. You said good things.”
“Chinese things,” said Lee. “I seem to get more Chinese as I get older.”
“There’s something changed about you, Lee. What is it?”
“It’s my queue, Mr. Hamilton. I’ve cut off my queue.”
“That’s it.”
“We all did. Haven’t you heard? The Dowager Em-press is gone. China is free. The Manchus are
not overlords and we do not wear queues. It was a procla-mation of the new government. There’s
not a queue left anywhere.”
“Does it make adifference, Lee?”
“Not much. It’s easier. But there’s a kind of looseness on the scalp that makes me uneasy. It’s
hard to get used to the convenience of it.”
“How is Adam?”
“He’s all right. But he hasn’t changed much. I won-der what he was like before.”
“Yes, I’ve wondered about that. It was a short flow-ering. The boys must be big.”
“They are big. I’m glad I stayed here. I learned a great deal from seeing the boys grow and
helping a little.”
“Did you teach them Chinese?”
“No. Mr. Trask didn’t want me to. And I guess he was right. It would have been a needless
complication. But I’m their friend—yes, I’m their friend. They ad-mire their father, but I think

they love me. And they’re very different. You can’t imagine how different.”
“In what way, Lee?”
“You’ll see when they come home from school. They’re like two sides of a medal. Cal is sharp
and dark and watchful, and his brother—well, he’s a boy you like before he speaks and like more
afterwards.”
“And you don’t like Cal?”
“I find myself defending him—to myself. He’s fighting for his life and his brother doesn’t have
to fight.”
“I have the same thing in my brood,” said Samuel. “I don’t understand it. You’d think with the
same training and the same blood they’d be alike, but they’re not—not at all.”
Later Samuel and Adam walked down the oak-shadowed road to the entrance to the draw where
they could look out at the Salinas Valley.
“Will you stay to dinner?” Adam asked.
“I will not be responsible for the murder of more chickens,” said Samuel.
“Lee’s got a pot roast.”
“Well, in that case—”
Adam still carried one shoulder lower than the other from the old hurt. His face was hard and
curtained, and his eyes looked at generalities and did not inspect details. The two men stopped in
the road and looked out at the valley, green tinged from the early rains.
Samuel said softly, “I wonder you do not feel a shame at leaving that land fallow.”
“I had no reason to plant it,” Adam said. “We had that out before. You thought I would change. I
have not changed.”
“Do you take pride in your hurt?” Samuel asked. “Does it make you seem large and tragic?”
“I don’t know.”
“Well, think about it. Maybe you’re playing a part on a great stage with only yourself as
audience.”
A slight anger came into Adam’s voice. “Why do you come to lecture me? I’m glad you’ve
come, but why do you dig into me?”
“To see whether I can raise a little anger in you. I’m a nosy man. But there’s all that fallow land,
and here beside me is all that fallow man. It seems a waste. And I have a bad feeling about waste
because I could never afford it. Is it a good feeling to let life lie fallow?”
“What else could I do?”
“You could try again.”
Adam faced him. “I’m afraid to, Samuel,” he said. “I’d rather just go about it this way. Maybe I
haven’t the energy or the courage.”
“How about your boys—do you love them?”
“Yes—yes.”
“Do you love one more than the other?”
“Why do you say that?”
“I don’t know. Something about your tone.”

“Let’s go back to the house,” said Adam. They strolled back under the trees. Suddenly Adam
said, “Did you ever hear that Cathy was in Salinas? Did you ever hear such a rumor?”
“Did you?”
“Yes—but I don’t believe it. I can’t believe it.”
Samuel walked silently in the sandy wheel rut of the road. His mind turned sluggishly in the
pattern of Adam and almost wearily took up a thought he had hoped was finished. He said at last,
“You have never let her go.”
“I guess not. But I’ve let the shooting go. I don’t think about it any more.”
“I can’t tell you how to live your life,” Samuel said, “although I do be telling you how to live it. I
know that it might be better for you to come out from under your might-have-beens, into the
winds of the world. And while I tell you, I am myself sifting my memories, the way men pan the
dirt under a barroom floor for the bits of gold dust that fall between the cracks. It’s small mining
—small mining. You’re too young a man to be panning memories, Adam. You should be getting
your-self some new ones, so that the mining will be richer when you come to age.”
Adam’s face was bent down, and his jawbone jutted below his temples from clenching.
Samuel glanced at him. “That’s right,” he said. “Set your teeth in it. How we do defend a
wrongness! Shall I tell you what you do, so you will not think you in-vented it? When you go to
bed and blow out the lamp—then she stands in the doorway with a little light behind her, and you
can see her nightgown stir. And she comes sweetly to your bed, and you, hardly breath-ing, turn
back the covers to receive her and move your head over on the pillow to make room for her head
beside yours. You can smell the sweetness of her skin, and it smells like no other skin in the world
—”
“Stop it,” Adam shouted at him. “Goddam you, stop it! Stop nosing over my life! You’re like a
coyote sniffing around a dead cow.”
“The way I know,” Samuel said softly, “is that one came to me that selfsame way—night after
month after year, right to the very now. And I think I should have double-bolted my mind and
sealed off my heart against her, but I did not. All of these years I’ve cheated Liza. I’ve given her
an untruth, a counterfeit, and I’ve saved the best for those dark sweet hours. And now I could
wish that she may have had some secret caller too. But I’ll never know that. I think she would
maybe have bolted her heart shut and thrown the key to hell.”
Adam’s hands were clenched and the blood was driv-en out of his white knuckles. “You make
me doubt myself,” he said fiercely. “You always have. I’m afraid of you. What should I do,
Samuel? Tell me! I don’t know how you saw the thing so clear. What should I do?”
“I know the ‘shoulds,’ although I never do them, Adam. I always know the ‘shoulds.’ You should
try to find a new Cathy. You should let the new Cathy kill the dream Cathy—let the two of them
fight it out. And you, sitting by, should marry your mind to the winner. That’s the second-best
should. The best would be to search out and find some fresh new loveliness to cancel out the old.”
“I’m afraid to try,” said Adam.
“That’s what you’ve said. And now I’m going to put a selfishness on you. I’m going away,
Adam. I came to say good-by.”

“What do you mean?”
“My daughter Olive has asked Liza and me to visit with her in Salinas, and we’re going—day
after tomor-row.”
“Well, you’ll be back.”
Samuel went on, “After we’ve visited with Olive for maybe a month or two, there will come a
letter from George. And his feelings will be hurt if we don’t visit him in Paso Robles. And after
that Mollie will want us in San Francisco, and then Will, and maybe even Joe in the East, if we
should live so long.”
“Well, won’t you like that? You’ve earned it. You’ve worked hard enough on that dust heap of
yours.”
“I love that dust heap,” Samuel said. “I love it the way a bitch loves her runty pup. I love every
flint, the plow-breaking outcroppings, the thin and barren top-soil, the waterless heart of her.
Somewhere in my dust heap there’s a richness.”
“You deserve a rest.”
“There, you’ve said it again,” said Samuel. “That’s what Ihad to accept,” and I have accepted.
When you say I deserve a rest, you are saying that my life is over.”
“Do you believe that?”
“That’s what I have accepted.”
Adam said excitedly, “You can’t do that. Why, if you accept that you won’t live!”
“I know,” said Samuel.
“But you can’t do that.”
“Why not?”
“I don’t want you to.”
“I’m a nosy old man, Adam. And the sad thing to me is that I’m losing my nosiness. That’s
maybe how I know it’s time to visit my children. I’m having to pretend to be nosy a good deal of
the time.”
“I’d rather you worked your guts out on your dust heap.”
Samuel smiled at him. “What a nice thing to hear! And I thank you. It’s a good thing to be loved,
even late.”
Suddenly Adam turned in front of him so that Sam-uel had to stop. “I know what you’ve done for
me,” Adam said. “I can’t return anything. But I can ask you for one more thing. If I asked you,
would you do me one more kindness, and maybe save my life?”
“I would if I could.”
Adam swung out his hand and made an arc over the west. “That land out there—would you help
me to make the garden we talked of, the windmills and the wells and the flats of alfalfa? We
could raise flower-seeds. There’s money in that. Think what it would be like, acres of sweet peas
and gold squares of calendulas. Maybe ten acres of roses for the gardens of the West. Think how
they would smell on the west wind!”
“You’re going to make me cry,” Samuel said, “and that would be an unseemly thing in an old
man.” And indeed his eyes were wet. “I thank you, Adam,” he said. “The sweetness of your offer

is a good smell on the west wind.”
“Then you’ll do it?”
“No, I will not do it. But I’ll see it in my mind when I’m in Salinas, listening to William Jennings
Bryan. And maybe I’ll get to believe it happened.”
“But I want to do it.”
“Go and see my Tom. He’ll help you. He’d plant the world with roses, poor man, if he could.”
“You know what you’re doing, Samuel?”
“Yes, I know what I’m doing, know so well that it’s half done.”
“What a stubborn man you are!”
“Contentious,” said Samuel. “Liza says I am conten-tious, but now I’m caught in a web of my
children—and I think I like it.”

The dinner table was set in the house. Lee said, “I’d have liked to serve it under the tree like the
other times, but the air is chilly.”
“So it is, Lee,” said Samuel.
The twins came in silently and stood shyly staring at their guest.
“It’s a long time since I’ve seen you, boys. But we named you well. You’re Caleb, aren’t you?”
“I’m Cal.”
“Well, Cal then.” And he turned to the other. “Have you found a way to rip the backbone out of
your name?”
“Sir?”
“Are you called Aaron?”
“Yes, sir.”
Lee chuckled. “He spells it with one a. The two a’s seem a little fancy to his friends.”
“I’ve got thirty-five Belgian hares, sir,” Aron said. “Would you like to see them, sir? The hutch is
up by the spring. I’ve got eight newborns—just born yester-day.”
“I’d like to see them, Aron.” His mouth twitched. “Cal, don’t tell me you’re a gardener?”
Lee’s head snapped around and he inspected Sam-uel. “Don’t do that,” Lee said nervously.
Cal said, “Next year my father is going to let me have an acre in the flat.”
Aron said, “I’ve got a buck rabbit weighs fifteen pounds. I’m going to give it to my father for his
birth-day.”
They heard Adam’s bedroom door opening. “Don’t tell him,” Aron said quickly. “It’s a secret.”
Lee sawed at the pot roast. “Always you bring trou-ble for my mind, Mr. Hamilton,” he said. “Sit
down, boys.”
Adam came in, turning down his sleeves, and took his seat at the head of the table. “Good
evening, boys,” he said, and they replied in unison, “Good evening, Father.”
And, “Don’t you tell,” said Aron.
“I won’t,” Samuel assured him. “Don’t tell what?” Adam asked. Samuel said, “Can’t there be a
privacy? I have a secret with your son.”

Cal broke in, “I’ll tell you a secret too, right after dinner.”
“I’ll like to hear it,” said Samuel. “And I do hope I don’t know already what it is.”
Lee looked up from his carving and glared at Sam-uel. He began piling meat on the plates.
The boys ate quickly and quietly, wolfed their food. Aron said, “Will you excuse us, Father?”
Adam nodded, and the two boys went quickly out. Samuel looked after them. “They seem older
than elev-en,” he said. “I seem to remember that at eleven my brood were howlers and screamers
and runners in cir-cles. These seem like grown men.”
“Do they?” Adam asked.
Lee said, “I think I see why that is. There is no woman in the house to put a value on babies. I
don’t think men care much for babies, and so it was never an advantage to these boys to be
babies. There was noth-ing to gain by it. I don’t know whether that is good or bad.”
Samuel wiped up the remains of gravy in his plate with a slice of bread. “Adam, I wonder
whether you know what you have in Lee. A philosopher who can cook, or a cook who can think?
He has taught me a great deal. You must have learned from him, Adam.”
Adam said, “I’m afraid I didn’t listen enough—or maybe he didn’t talk.”
“Why didn’t you want the boys to learn Chinese, Adam?”
Adam thought for a moment. “It seems a time for honesty,” he said at last. “I guess it was plain
jealousy. I gave it another name, but maybe I didn’t want them to be able so easily to go away
from me in a direction I couldn’t follow.”
“That’s reasonable, enough and almost too human,” said Samuel. “But knowing it—that’s a great
jump. I wonder whether I have ever gone so far.”
Lee brought the gray enameled coffeepot to the table and filled the cups and sat down. He
warmed the palm of his hand against the rounded side of his cup. And then Lee laughed. “You’ve
given me great trouble, Mr. Hamilton, and you’ve disturbed the tranquillity of China.”
“How do you mean, Lee?”
“It almost seems that I have told you this,” said Lee. “Maybe I only composed it in my mind,
meaning to tell you. It’s an amusing story anyway.”
“I want to hear,” said Samuel, and he looked at Adam. “Don’t you want to hear, Adam? Or are
you slipping into your cloud bath?”
“I was thinking of that,” said Adam. “It’s funny—a kind of excitement is coming over me.”
“That’s good,” said Samuel. “Maybe that’s the best of all good things that can happen to a
human. Let’s hear your story, Lee.”
The Chinese reached to the side of his neck and he smiled. “I wonder whether I’ll ever get used to
the lack of a queue,” he said. “I guess I used it more than I knew. Yes, the story. I told you, Mr.
Hamilton, that I was growing more Chinese. Do you ever grow more Irish?”
“It comes and goes,” said Samuel.
“Do you remember when you read us the sixteen verses of the fourth chapter of Genesis and we
argued about them?”
“I do indeed. And that’s a long time ago.”
“Ten years nearly,” said Lee. “Well, the story bit deeply into me and I went into it word for word.

The more I thought about the story, the more profound it became to me. Then I compared the
translations we have—and they were fairly close. There was only one place that bothered me.
The King James version says this—it is when Jehovah has asked Cain why he is angry. Jehovah
says, ‘If thou doest well, shall thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the
door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.’ It was the ‘thou shalt’ that
struck me, because it was a promise that Cain would conquer sin.”
Samuel nodded. “And his children didn’t do it en-tirely,” he said.
Lee sipped his coffee. “Then I got a copy of the American Standard Bible. It was very new then.
And it was different in this passage. It says, ‘Do thou rule over him.’ Now this is very different.
This is not a promise, it is an order. And I began to stew about it. I wondered what the original
word of the original writer had been that these very different translations could be made.”
Samuel put his palms down on the table and leaned forward and the old young light came into his
eyes. “Lee,” he said, “don’t tell me you studied Hebrew!”
Lee said, “I’m going to tell you. And it’s a fairly long story. Will you have a touch of ng-ka-py?”
“You mean the drink that tastes of good rotten ap-ples?”
“Yes. I can talk better with it.”
“Maybe I can listen better,” said Samuel.
While Lee went to the kitchen Samuel asked, “Adam, did you know about this?”
“No,” said Adam. “He didn’t tell me. Maybe I wasn’t listening.”
Lee came back with his stone bottle and three little porcelain cups so thin and delicate that the
light shone through them. “Dlinkee Chinee, fashion,” he said and poured the almost black liquor.
“There’s a lot of worm-wood in this. It’s quite a drink,” he said. “Has about the same effect as
absinthe if you drink enough of it.”
Samuel sipped the drink. “I want to know why you were so interested,” he said.
“Well, it seemed to me that the man who could conceive this great story would know exactly
what he wanted to say and there would be no confusion in his statement.”
“You say ‘the man.’ Do you then not think this is a divine book written by the inky finger of
God?”
“I think the mind that could think this story was a curiously divine mind. We have had a few such
minds in China too.”
“I just wanted to know,” said Samuel. “You’re not a Presbyterian after all.”
“I told you I was getting more Chinese. Well, to go on, I went to San Francisco to the
headquarters of our family association. Do you know about them? Our great families have centers
where any member can get help or give it. The Lee family is very large. It takes care of its own.”
“I have heard of them,” said Samuel.
“You mean Chinee hatchet man fightee Tong war over slave girl?”
“I guess so.”
“It’s a little different from that, really,” said Lee. “I went there because in our family there are a
number of ancient reverend gentlemen who are great scholars. They are thinkers in exactness. A
man may spend many years pondering a sentence of the scholar you call Confucius. I thought

there might be experts in meaning who could advise me.
“They are fine old men. They smoke their two pipes of opium in the afternoon and it rests and
sharpens them, and they sit through the night and their minds are wonderful. I guess no other
people have been able to use opium well.”
Lee dampened his tongue in the black brew. “I respectfully submitted my problem to one of these
sages, read him the story, and told him what I under-stood from it. The next night four of them
met and called me in. We discussed the story all night long.”
Lee laughed. “I guess it’s funny,” he said. “I know I wouldn’t dare tell it to many people. Can
you imagine four old gentlemen, the youngest is over ninety now, taking on the study of Hebrew?
They engaged a learned rabbi. They took to the study as though they were children. Exercise
books, grammar, vocabulary, simple sentences. You should see Hebrew written in Chinese ink
with a brush! The right to left didn’t bother them as much as it would you, since we write up to
down. Oh, they were perfectionists! They went to the root of the matter.”
“And you?” said Samuel.
“I went along with them, marveling at the beauty of their proud clean brains. I began to love my
race, and for the first time I wanted to be Chinese. Every two weeks I went to a meeting with
them, and in my room here I covered pages with writing. I bought every known Hebrew
dictionary. But the old gentlemen were always ahead of me. It wasn’t long before they were
ahead of our rabbi; he brought a colleague in. Mr. Hamilton, you should have sat through some of
those nights of argument and discussion. The questions, the inspection, oh, the lovely thinking—
the beautiful think-ing.
“After two years we felt that we could approach your sixteen verses of the fourth chapter of
Genesis. My old gentlemen felt that these words were very im-portant too—’Thou shalt’ and ‘Do
thou.’ And this was the gold from our mining: ‘Thou mayest.’ ‘Thou mayest rule over sin.’ The
old gentlemen smiled and nodded and felt the years were well spent. It brought them out of their
Chinese shells too, and right now they are studying Greek.”
Samuel said, “It’s a fantastic story. And I’ve tried to follow and maybe I’ve missed somewhere.
Why is this word so important?”
Lee’s hand shook as he filled the delicate cups. He drank his down in one gulp. “Don’t you see?”
he cried. “The American Standard translation orders men to triumph over sin, and you can call
sin ignorance. The King James translation makes a promise in ‘Thou shalt,’ meaning that men
will surely triumph over sin. But the Hebrew word, the word timshel—‘Thou mayest’—that gives
a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open. That
throws it right back on a man. For if ‘Thou mayest’—it is also true that ‘Thou mayest not.’ Don’t
you see?”
“Yes, I see. I do see. But you do not believe this is divine law. Why do you feel its importance?”
“Ah!” said Lee. “I’ve wanted to tell you this for a long time. I even anticipated your questions
and I am well prepared. Any writing which has influenced the thinking and the lives of
innumerable people is impor-tant. Now, there are many millions in their sects and churches who
feel the order, ‘Do thou,’ and throw their weight into obedience. And there are millions more who

feel predestination in ‘Thou shalt.’ Nothing they may do can interfere with what will be. But
“Thou mayest’! Why, that makes a man great, that gives him stature with the gods, for in his
weakness and his filth and his murder of his brother he has still the great choice. He can choose
his course and fight it through and win.” Lee’s voice was a chant of triumph.
Adam said, “Do you believe that, Lee?”
“Yes, I do. Yes, I do. It is easy out of laziness, out of weakness, to throw oneself into the lap of
deity, saying, ‘I couldn’t help it; the way was set.’ But think of the glory of the choice! That
makes a man a man. A cat has no choice, a bee must make honey. There’s no godliness there.
And do you know, those old gentlemen who were sliding gently down to death are too inter-ested
to die now?”
Adam said, “Do you mean these Chinese men be-lieve the Old Testament?”
Lee said, “These old men believe a true story, and they know a true story when they hear it. They
are critics of truth. They know that these sixteen verses are a history of humankind in any age or
culture or race. They do not believe a man writes fifteen and three-quarter verses of truth and tells
a lie with one verb. Confucius tells men how they should live to have good and successful lives.
But this—this is a ladder to climb to the stars.” Lee’s eyes shone. “You can never lose that. It
cuts the feet from under weakness and coward-liness and laziness.”
Adam said, “I don’t see how you could cook and raise the boys and take care of me and still do
all this.”
“Neither do I,” said Lee. “But I take my two pipes in the afternoon, no more and no less, like the
elders. And I feel that I am a man. And I feel that a man is a very important thing—maybe more
important than a star. This is not theology. I have no bent toward gods. But I have a new love for
that glittering instrument, the human soul. It is a lovely and unique thing in the universe. It is
always attacked and never destroyed—because ‘Thou mayest.’ ”

Lee and Adam walked out to the shed with Samuel to see him off. Lee carried a tin lantern to
light the way, for it was one of those clear early winter nights when the sky riots with stars and
the earth seems doubly dark because of them. A silence lay on the hills. No animal moved about,
neither grass-eater nor predator, and the air was so still that the dark limbs and leaves of the live
oaks stood unmoving against the Milky Way. The three men were silent. The bail of the tin
lantern squeaked a little as the light swung in Lee’s hand.
Adam asked, “When do you think you’ll be back from your trip?”
Samuel did not answer.
Doxology stood patiently in the stall, head down, his milky eyes staring at the straw under his
feet.
“You’ve had that horse forever,” Adam said.
“He’s thirty-three,” said Samuel. “His teeth are worn off. I have to feed him warm mash with my
fingers. And he has bad dreams. He shivers and cries some-times in his sleep.”
“He’s about as ugly a crow bait as I ever saw,” Adam said.

“I know it. I think that’s why I picked him when he was a colt. Do you know I paid two dollars
for him thirty-three years ago? Everything was wrong with him, hoofs like flapjacks, a hock so
thick and short and straight there seems no joint at all. He’s hammerheaded and swaybacked. He
has a pinched chest and a big behind. He has an iron mouth and he still fights the crupper. With a
saddle he feels as though you were riding a sled over a gravel pit. He can’t trot and he stumbles
over his feet when he walks. I have never in thirty-three years found one good thing about him.
He even has an ugly disposition. He is selfish and quarrel-some and mean and disobedient. To
this day I don’t dare walk behind him because he will surely take a kick at me. When I feed him
mash he tries to bite my hand. And I love him.”
Lee said, “And you named him ‘Doxology.’ ”
“Surely,” said Samuel, “so ill endowed a creature deserved, I thought, one grand possession. He
hasn’t very long now.”
Adam said, “Maybe you should put him out of his misery.”
“What misery?” Samuel demanded. “He’s one of the few happy and consistent beings I’ve ever
met.”
“He must have aches and pains.”
“Well, he doesn’t think so. Doxology still thinks he’s one hell of a horse. Would you shoot him,
Adam?”
“Yes, I think I would. Yes, I would.”
“You’d take the responsibility?”
“Yes, I think I would. He’s thirty-three. His lifespan is long over.”
Lee had set his lantern on the ground. Samuel squatted beside it and instinctively stretched his
hands for warmth to the butterfly of yellow light.
“I’ve been bothered by something, Adam,” he said.
“What is that?”
“You would really shoot my horse because death might be more comfortable?”
“Well, I meant—”
Samuel said quickly, “Do you like your life, Adam?”
“Of course not.”
“If I had a medicine that might cure you and also might kill you, should I give it to you? Inspect
your-self, man.”
“What medicine?”
“No,” said Samuel. “If I tell you, believe me when I say it may kill you.”
Lee said, “Be careful, Mr. Hamilton. Be careful.”
“What is this?” Adam demanded. “Tell me what you’re thinking of.”
Samuel said softly, “I think for once I will not be careful. Lee, if I am wrong—listen—if I am
mistaken, I accept the responsibility and I will take what blame there is to take.”
“Are you sure you’re right?” Lee asked anxiously.
“Of course I’m not sure. Adam, do you want the medicine?”
“Yes. I don’t know what it is but give it to me.”

“Adam, Cathy is in Salinas. She owns a whorehouse, the most vicious and depraved in this whole
end of the country. The evil and ugly, the distorted and slimy, the worst things humans can think
up are for sale there. The crippled and crooked come there for satisfaction. But it is worse than
that. Cathy, and she is now called Kate, takes the fresh and young and beautiful and so maims
them that they can never be whole again. Now, there’s your medicine. Let’s see what it does to
you.”
“You’re a liar!” Adam said.
“No, Adam. Many things I am, but a liar I am not.”
Adam whirled on Lee. “Is this true?”
“I’m no antidote,” said Lee. “Yes. It’s true.”
Adam stood swaying in the lantern light and then he turned and ran. They could hear his heavy
steps run-ning and tripping. They heard him falling over the brush and scrambling and clawing
his way upward on the slope. The sound of him stopped only when he had gone over the brow of
the hill.
Lee said, “Your medicine acts like poison.”
“I take responsibility,” said Samuel. “Long ago I learned this: When a dog has eaten strychnine
and is going to die, you must get an ax and carry him to a chopping block. Then you must wait
for his next con-vulsion, and in that moment—chop off his tail. Then, if the poison has not gone
too far, your dog may recover. The shock of pain can counteract the poison. Without the shock he
will surely die.”
“But how do you know this is the same?” Lee asked.
“I don’t. But without it he would surely die.”
“You’re a brave man,” Lee said.
“No, I’m an old man. And if I should have anything on my conscience it won’t be for long.”
Lee asked, “What do you suppose he’ll do?”
“I don’t know,” said Samuel, “but at least he won’t sit around and mope. Here, hold the lantern
for me, will you?”
In the yellow light Samuel slipped the bit in Doxology’s mouth, a bit worn so thin that it was a
flake of steel. The check rein had been abandoned long ago. The old hammerhead was free to
drag his nose if he wished, or to pause and crop grass beside the road. Samuel didn’t care.
Tenderly he buckled the crupper, and the horse edged around to try to kick him.
When Dox was between the shafts of the cart Lee asked, “Would you mind if I rode along with
you a little? I’ll walk back.”
“Come along,” said Samuel, and he tried not to notice that Lee helped him up into the cart.
The night was very dark, and Dox showed his dis-gust for night-traveling by stumbling every few
steps.
Samuel said, “Get on with it, Lee. What is it you want to say?”
Lee did not appear surprised. “Maybe I’m nosy the way you say you are. I get to thinking. I know
proba-bilities, but tonight you fooled me completely. I would have taken any bet that you of all
men would not have told Adam.”

“Did you know about her?”
“Of course,” said Lee,
“Do the boys know?”
“I don’t think so, but that’s only a matter of time. You know how cruel children are. Someday in
the schoolyard it will be shouted at them.”
“Maybe he ought to take them away from here,” said Samuel. “Think about that, Lee.”
“My question isn’t answered, Mr. Hamilton. How were you able to do what you did?”
“Do you think I was that wrong?”
“No, I don’t mean that at all. But I’ve never thought of you as taking any strong unchanging
stand on any-thing. This has been my judgment. Are you inter-ested?”
“Show me the man who isn’t interested in discussing himself,” said Samuel. “Go on.”
“You’re a kind man, Mr. Hamilton. And I’ve always thought it was the kindness that comes from
not want-ing any trouble. And your mind is as facile as a young lamb leaping in a daisy field.
You have never to my knowledge taken a bulldog grip on anything. And then tonight you did a
thing that tears down my whole picture of you.”
Samuel wrapped the lines around a stick stuck in the whip socket, and Doxology stumbled on
down the rutty road. The old man stroked his beard, and it shone very white in the starlight. He
took off his black hat and laid it in his lap. “I guess it surprised me as much as it did you,” he
said. “But if you want to know why—look into yourself.”
“I don’t understand you.”
“If you had only told me about your studies earlier it might have made a great difference, Lee.”
“I still don’t understand you.”
“Careful, Lee, you’ll get me talking. I told you my Irish came and went. It’s coming now.”
Lee said, “Mr. Hamilton, you’re going away and you’re not coming back. You do not intend to
live very much longer.”
“That’s true, Lee. How did you know?”
“There’s death all around you. It shines from you.”
“I didn’t know anyone could see it,” Samuel said. “You know, Lee, I think of my life as a kind of
music, not always good music but still having form and melo-dy. And my life has not been a full
orchestra for a long time now. A single note only—and that note unchang-ing sorrow. I’m not
alone in my attitude, Lee. It seems to me that too many of us conceive of a life as ending in
defeat.”
Lee said, “Maybe everyone is too rich. I have no-ticed that there is no dissatisfaction like that of
the rich. Feed a man, clothe him, put him in a good house, and he will die of despair.”
“It was your two-word retranslation, Lee—”Thou mayest.’ It took me by the throat and shook
me. And when the dizziness was over, a path was open, new and bright. And my life which is
ending seems to be going on to an ending wonderful. And my music has a new last melody like a
bird song in the night.”
Lee was peering at him’ through the darkness. “That’s what it did to those old men of my family.”
“ ‘Thou mayest rule over sin,’ Lee. That’s it. I do not believe all men are destroyed. I can name

you a dozen who were not, and they are the ones the world lives by. It is true of the spirit as it is
true of battles—only the winners are remembered. Surely most men are destroyed, but there are
others who like pillars of fire guide frightened men through the darkness. ‘Thou mayest, Thou
mayest!’ What glory! It is true that we are weak and sick and quarrelsome, but if that is all we
ever were, we would, millenniums ago, have disap-peared from the face of the earth. A few
remnants of fossilized jawbone, some broken teeth in strata of lime-stone, would be the only
mark man would have left of his existence in the world. But the choice, Lee, the choice of
winning! I had never understood it or ac-cepted it before. Do you see now why I told Adam tonight? I exercised the choice. Maybe I was wrong, but by telling him I also forced him to live or
get off the pot. What is that word, Lee?”
“Timshel,” said Lee. “Will you stop the cart?”
“You’ll have a long walk back.”
Lee climbed down. “Samuel!” he said.
“Here am I.” The old man chuckled. “Liza hates for me to say that.”
“Samuel, you’ve gone beyond me.”
“It’s time, Lee.”
“Good-by, Samuel,” Lee said, and he walked hur-riedly back along the road. He heard the iron
tires of the cart grinding on the road. He turned and looked after it, and on the slope he saw old
Samuel against the sky, his white hair shining with starlight.

Chapter 25
1
It was a deluge of a winter in the Salinas Valley, wet and wonderful. The rains fell gently and
soaked in and did not freshet. The feed was deep in January, and in February the hills were fat
with grass and the coats of the cattle looked tight and sleek. In March the soft rains continued,
and each storm waited courteously until its predecessor sank beneath the ground. Then warmth
flooded the valley and the earth burst into bloom—yellow and blue and gold.
Tom was alone on the ranch, and even that dust heap was rich and lovely and the flints were
hidden in grass and the Hamilton cows were fat and the Hamilton sheep sprouted grass from their
damp backs.
At noon on March 15 Tom sat on the bench outside the forge. The sunny morning was over, and
gray water-bearing clouds sailed in over the mountains from the ocean, and their shadows slid
under them on the bright earth.
Tom heard a horse’s clattering hoofs and he saw a small boy, elbows flapping, urging a tired
horse toward the house. He stood up and walked toward the road. The boy galloped up to the
house, yanked off his hat, flung a yellow envelope on the ground, spun his horse around, and
kicked up a gallop again.
Tom started to call after him, and then he leaned wearily down and picked up the telegram. He sat
in the sun on the bench outside the forge, holding the tele-gram in his hand. And he looked at the
hills and at the old house, as though to save something, before he tore open the envelope and read
the inevitable four words, the person, the event, and the time.
Tom slowly folded the telegram and folded it again and again until it was a square no larger than
his thumb. He walked to the house, through the kitchen, through the little living room, and into
his bedroom. He took his dark suit out of the clothespress and laid it over the back of a chair, and
he put a white shirt and a black tie on the seat of the chair. And then he lay down on the bed and
turned his face to the wall.

2
The surreys and the buggies had driven out of the Salinas cemetery. The family and friends went
back to Olive’s house on Central Avenue to eat and to drink coffee, to see how each one was
taking it, and to do and say the decent things.
George offered Adam Trask a lift in his rented sur-rey, but Adam refused. He wandered around
the ceme-tery and sat down on the cement curb of the Williams family plot. The traditional dark
cypresses wept around the edge of the cemetery, and white violets ran wild in the pathways.
Someone had brought them in and they had become weeds.
The cold wind blew over the tombstones and cried in the cypresses. There were many cast-iron

stars, marking the graves of Grand Army men, and on each star a small wind-bitten flag from a
year ago Decoration Day.
Adam sat looking at the mountains to the east of Salinas, with the noble point of Frémont’s Peak
domi-nating. The air was crystalline as it sometimes is when rain is coming. And then the light
rain began to blow on the wind although the sky was not properly covered with cloud.
Adam had come up on the morning train. He had not intended to come at all, but something drew
him beyond his power to resist. For one thing, he could not believe that Samuel was dead. He
could hear the rich, lyric voice in his ears, the tones rising and falling in their foreignness, and the
curious music of oddly cho-sen words tripping out so that you were never sure what the next
word would be. In the speech of most men you are absolutely sure what the next word will be.
Adam had looked at Samuel in his casket and knew that he didn’t want him to be dead. And since
the face in the casket did not look like Samuel’s face, Adam walked away to be by himself and to
preserve the man alive.
He had to go to the cemetery. Custom would have been outraged else. But he stood well back
where he could not hear the words, and when the sons filled in the grave he had walked away and
strolled in the paths where the white violets grew.
The cemetery was deserted and the dark crooning of the wind bowed the heavy cypress trees. The
rain drop-lets grew larger and drove stinging along.
Adam stood up, shivered, and walked slowly over the white violets and past the new grave. The
flowers had been laid evenly to cover the mound of new-turned damp earth, and already the wind
had frayed the blos-soms and flung the smaller bouquets out into the path. Adam picked them up
and laid them back on the mound.
He walked out of the cemetery. The wind and the rain were at his back, and he ignored the
wetness that soaked through his black coat. Romie Lane was muddy with pools of water standing
in the new wheel ruts, and the tall wild oats and mustard grew beside the road, with wild turnip
forcing its boisterous way up and stickery beads of purple thistles rising above the green riot of
the wet spring.
The black ’dobe mud covered Adam’s shoes and splashed the bottoms of his dark trousers. It was
nearly a mile to the Monterey road. Adam was dirty and soaking when he reached it and turned
east into the town of Salinas. The water was standing in the curved brim of his derby hat and his
collar was wet and sagging.
At John Street the road angled and became Main Street. Adam stamped the mud off his shoes
when he reached the pavement. The buildings cut the wind from him and almost instantly he
began to shake with a chill. He increased his speed. Near the other end of Main Street he turned
into the Abbot House bar. He ordered brandy and drank it quickly and his shivering increased.
Mr. Lapierre behind the bar saw the chill. “You’d better have another one,” he said. “You’ll get a
bad cold. Would you like a hot rum? That will knock it out of you.”
“Yes, I would,” said Adam.
“Well, here. You sip another cognac while I get some hot water.”
Adam took his glass to a table and sat uncomfortably in his wet clothes. Mr. Lapierre brought a

steaming kettle from the kitchen. He put the squat glass on a tray and brought it to the table.
“Drink it as hot as you can stand it,” he said. “That will shake the chill out of an aspen.” He drew
a chair up, sat down, then stood up. “You’ve made me cold,” he said. “I’m going to have one
myself.” He brought his glass back to the table and sat across from Adam. “It’s working,” he
said. “You were so pale you scared me when you came in. You’re a stranger?”
“I’m from near King City,” Adam said.
“Come up for the funeral?”
“Yes—he was an old friend.”
“Big funeral?”
“Oh, yes.”
“I’m not surprised. He had lots of friends. Too bad it couldn’t have been a nice day. You ought to
have one more and then go to bed.”
“I will,” said Adam. “It makes me comfortable and peaceful.”
“That’s worth something. Might have saved you from pneumonia too.”
After he had served another toddy he brought a damp cloth from behind the bar. “You can wipe
off some of that mud,” he said. “A funeral isn’t very gay, but when it gets rained on—that’s
really mournful.”
“It didn’t rain till after,” said Adam. “It was walking back I got wet.”
“Why don’t you get a nice room right here? You get into bed and I’ll send a toddy up to you, and
in the morning you’ll be fine.”
“I think I’ll do that,” said Adam. He could feel the blood stinging his cheeks and running hotly in
his arms, as though it were some foreign warm fluid tak-ing over his body. Then the warmth
melted through into the cold concealed box where he stored forbidden thoughts, and the thoughts
came timidly up to the surface like children who do not know whether they will be received.
Adam picked up the damp cloth and leaned down to sponge off the bottoms of his trousers. The
blood pounded behind his eyes. “I might have one more toddy,” he said.
Mr. Lapierre said, “If it’s for cold, you’ve had enough. But if you just want a drink I’ve got some
old Jamaica rum. I’d rather you’d have that straight. It’s fifty years old. The water would kill the
flavor.”
“I just want a drink,” said Adam.
“I’ll have one with you. I haven’t opened that jug in months. Not much call for it. This is a
whisky-drinking town.”
Adam wiped off his shoes and dropped the cloth on the floor. He took a drink of the dark rum and
coughed. The heavy-muscled drink wrapped its sweet aroma around his head and struck at the
base of his nose like a blow. The room seemed to tip sideways and then right itself.
“Good, isn’t it?” Mr. Lapierre asked. “But it can knock you over. I wouldn’t have more than one
—unless of course you want to get knocked over. Some do.”
Adam leaned his elbows on the table. He felt a garrulousness coming on him and he was
frightened at the impulse. His voice did not sound like his voice, and his words amazed him.
“I don’t get up here much,” he said. “Do you know a place called Kate’s?”

“Jesus! That rum is better than I thought,” Mr. Lapierre said, and he went on sternly, “You live
on a ranch?”
“Yes. Got a place near King City. My name’s Trask.”
“Glad to meet you. Married?”
“No. Not now.”
“Widower?”
“Yes.”
“You go to Jenny’s. Let Kate alone. That’s not good for you. Jenny’s is right next door. You go
there and you’ll get everything you need.”
“Right next door?”
“Sure, you go east a block and a half and turn right. Anybody’ll tell you where the Line is.”
Adam’s tongue was getting thick. “What’s the matter with Kate’s?”
“You go to Jenny’s,” said Mr. Lapierre.

It was a dirty gusty evening. Castroville Street was deep in sticky mud, and Chinatown was so
flooded that its inhabitants had laid planks across the narrow street that separated their hutches.
The clouds against the evening sky were the gray of rats, and the air was not damp but dank. I
guess the difference is that dampness comes down but dankness rises up out of rot and
fermentation. The afternoon wind had dropped away and left the air raw and wounded. It was
cold enough to shake out the curtains of rum in Adam’s head with-out restoring his timidity. He
walked quickly down the unpaved sidewalks, his eyes on the ground to avoid stepping in puddles.
The row was dimly lit by the warning lantern where the railroad crossed the street and by one
small carbon-filamented globe that burned on the porch of Jenny’s.
Adam had his instructions. He counted two houses and nearly missed the third, so high and
unbridled were the dark bushes in front of it. He looked in through the gateway at the dark porch,
slowly opened the gate, and went up the overgrown path. In the half-darkness he could see the
sagging dilapidated porch and the shaky steps.
The paint had long disappeared from the clapboard walls and no work had ever been done on the
garden. If it had not been for the vein of light around the edges of the drawn shades he would
have passed on, thinking the house deserted. The stair treads seemed to crumple under his weight
and the porch planks squealed as he crossed them.
The front door opened, and he could see a dim figure holding the knob.
A soft voice said, “Won’t you come in?”
The reception room was dimly lighted by small globes set under rose-colored shades. Adam
could feel a thick carpet under his feet. He could see the shine of polished furniture and the gleam
of gold picture frames. He got a quick impression of richness and order.
The soft voice said, “You should have worn a rain-coat. Do we know you?”
“No, you don’t,” said Adam.
“Who sent you?”

“A man at the hotel.” Adam peered at the girl before him. She was dressed in black and wore no
ornaments. Her face was sharp—pretty and sharp. He tried to think of what animal, what night
prowler, she reminded him. It was some secret and predatory animal.
The girl said, “I’ll move nearer to a lamp if you like.”
“No.”
She laughed. “Sit down—over here. You did come here for something, didn’t you? If you’ll tell
me what you want I’ll call the proper girl.” The low voice had a precise and husky power. And
she picked her words as one picks flowers in a mixed garden and took her time choosing.
She made Adam seem clumsy to himself. He blurted out, “I want to see Kate.”
“Miss Kate is busy now. Does she expect you?”
“No.”
“I can take care of you, you know.”
“I want to see Kate.”
“Can you tell me what you want to see her about?”
“No.”
The girl’s voice took on the edge of a blade sharp-ened on a stone. “You can’t see her. She’s
busy. If you don’t want a girl or something else, you’d better go away.”
“Well, will you tell her I’m here?”
“Does she know you?”
“I don’t know.” He felt his courage going. This was a remembered cold. “I don’t know. But will
you tell her that Adam Trask would like to see her? She’ll know then whether I know her or not.”
“I see. Well, I’ll tell her.” She moved silently to a door on the right and opened it. Adam heard a
few muffled words and a man looked through the door. The girl left the door open so that Adam
would know he was not alone. On one side of the room heavy dark portieres hung over a
doorway. The girl parted the deep folds and disappeared. Adam sat back in his chair. Out of the
side of his eyes he saw the man’s head thrust in and then withdrawn.
Kate’s private room was comfort and efficiency. It did not look at all like the room where Faye
had lived. The walls were clad in saffron silk and the drapes were apple green. It was a silken
room—deep chairs with silk-upholstered cushions, lamps with silken shades, a broad bed at the
far end of the room with a gleaming white satin cover on which were piled gigantic pil-lows.
There was no picture on the wall, no photograph or personal thing of any kind. A dressing table
near the bed had no bottle or vial on its ebony top, and its sheen was reflected in triple mirrors.
The rug was old and deep and Chinese, an apple-green dragon on saffron. One end of the room
was bedroom, the center was social, and the other end was office—filing cabinets of golden oak,
a large safe, black with gold lettering, and a rolltop desk with a green-hooded double lamp over
it, a swivel chair behind it and a straight chair beside it.
Kate sat in the swivel chair behind the desk. She was still pretty. Her hair was blond again. Her
mouth was little and firm and turned up at the corners as always. But her outlines were not sharp
anywhere. Her shoul-ders had become plump while her hands grew lean and wrinkled. Her
cheeks were chubby and the skin under her chin was crepe. Her breasts were still tiny, but a

padding of fat protruded her stomach a little. Her hips were slender, but her legs and feet had
thickened so that a bulge hung over her low shoes. And through her stockings, faintly, could be
seen the wrappings of elastic bandage to support the veins.
Still, she was pretty and neat. Only her hands had really aged, the palms and fingerpads shining
and tight, the backs wrinkled and splotched with brown. She was dressed severely in a dark dress
with long sleeves, and the only contrast was billowing white lace at her wrists and throat.
The work of the years had been subtle. If one had been near by it is probable that no change at all
would have been noticed. Kate’s cheeks were unlined, her eyes sharp and shallow, her nose
delicate, and her lips thin and firm. The scar on her forehead was barely visible. It was covered
with a powder tinted to match Kate’s skin.
Kate inspected a sheaf of photographs on her rolltop desk, all the same size, all taken by the same
camera and bright with flash powder. And although the charac-ters were different in each picture,
there was a dreary similarity about their postures. The faces of the women were never toward the
camera.
Kate arranged the pictures in four piles and slipped each pile into a heavy manila envelope. When
the knock came on her door she put the envelopes in a pigeonhole of her desk. “Come in. Oh,
come in, Eva. Is he here?”
The girl came to the desk before she replied. In the increased light her face showed tight and her
eyes were shiny. “It’s a new one, a stranger. He says he wants to see you.”
“Well, he can’t, Eva. You know who’s coming.”
“I told him you couldn’t see him. He said he thought he knew you.”
“Well, who is he, Eva?”
“He’s a big gangly man, a little bit drunk. He says his name is Adam Trask.”
Although Kate made no movement or sound Eva knew something had struck home. The fingers
of Kate’s right hand slowly curled around the palm while the left hand crept like a lean cat toward
the edge of the desk. Kate sat still as though she held her breath. Eva was jittery. Her mind went
to the box in her dresser drawer where her hypodermic needle lay.
Kate said at last, “Sit over there in that big chair, Eva. Just sit still a minute.” When the girl did
not move Kate whipped one word at her. “Sit!” Eva cringed and went to the big chair.
“Don’t pick your nails,” said Kate.
Eva’s hands separated, and each one clung to an arm of the chair.
Kate stared straight ahead at the green glass shades of her desk lamp. Then she moved so
suddenly that Eva jumped and her lips quivered. Kate opened the desk drawer and took out a
folded paper. “Here! Go to your room and fix yourself up. Don’t take it all—no, I won’t trust
you.” Kate tapped the paper and tore it in two; a little white powder spilled before she folded the
ends and passed one to Eva. “Now hurry up! When you come downstairs, tell Ralph I want him
in the hall close enough to hear the bell but not the voices. Watch him to see he doesn’t creep up.
If he hears the bell—no, tell him—no, let him do it his own way. After that bring Mr. Adam
Trask to me.”
“Will you be all right, Miss Kate?”

Kate looked at her until she turned away. Kate called after her, “You can have the other half as
soon as he goes. Now hurry up.”
After the door had closed Kate opened the right-hand drawer of her desk and took out a revolver
with a short barrel. She swung the cylinder sideways and looked at the cartridges, snapped it shut
and put it on her desk, and laid a sheet of paper over it. She turned off one of the lights and settled
back in her chair. She clasped her hands on the desk in front of her.
When the knock came on the door she called, “Come in,” hardly moving her lips.
Eva’s eyes were wet, and she was relaxed. “Here he is,” she said and closed the door behind
Adam.
He glanced quickly about before he saw Kate sitting so quietly behind the desk. He stared at her,
and then he moved slowly toward her.
Her hands unclasped and her right hand moved toward the paper. Her eyes, cold and
expressionless, remained on his eyes.
Adam saw her hair, her scar, her lips, her creping throat, her arms and shoulders and flat breasts.
He sighed deeply.
Kate’s hand shook a little. She said, “What do you want?”
Adam sat down in the straight chair beside the desk. He wanted to shout with relief, but he said,
“Nothing now. I just wanted to see you. Sam Hamilton told me you were here.”
The moment he sat down the shake went out of her hand. “Hadn’t you heard before?”
“No,” he said. “I hadn’t heard. It made me a little crazy at first, but now I’m all right.”
Kate relaxed and her mouth smiled and her little teeth showed, the long canines sharp and white.
She said, “You frightened me.”
“Why?”
“Well, I didn’t know what you’d do.”
“Neither did I,” said Adam, and he continued to stare at her as though she were not alive.
“I expected you for a long time, and when you didn’t come I guess I forgot you.”
“I didn’t forget you,” he said. “But now I can.”
“What do you mean?”
He laughed pleasantly. “Now I see you, I mean. You know, I guess it was Samuel said I’d never
seen you, and it’s true. I remember your face but I had never seen it. Now I can forget it.”
Her lips closed and straightened and her wide-set eyes narrowed with cruelty. “You think you
can?”
“I know I can.”
She changed her manner. “Maybe you won’t have to,” she said. “If you feel all right about
everything, maybe we could get together.”
“I don’t think so,” said Adam.
“You were such a fool,” she said. “Like a child. You didn’t know what things to do with yourself.
I can teach you now. You seem to be a man.”
“You have taught me,” he said. “It was a pretty sharp lesson.”
“Would you like a drink?”

“Yes,” he said.
“I can smell your breath—you’ve been drinking rum.” She got up and went to a cabinet for a
bottle and two glasses, and when she turned back she noticed that he was looking at her fattened
ankles. Her quick rage did not change the little smile on her lips.
She carried the bottle to the round table in the middle of the room and filled the two small glasses
with rum. “Come, sit over here,” she said. “It’s more com-fortable.” As he moved to a big chair
she saw that his eyes were on her protruding stomach. She handed him a glass, sat down, and
folded her hands across her middle.
He sat holding his glass, and she said, “Drink it. It’s very good rum.” He smiled at her, a smile
she had never seen. She said, “When Eva told me you were here I thought at first I would have
you thrown out.”
“I would have come back,” he said. “I had to see you—not that I mistrusted Samuel, but just to
prove it to myself.”
“Drink your rum,” she said.
He glanced at her glass.
“You don’t think I’d poison you—” She stopped and was angry that she had said it.
Smiling, he still gazed at her glass. Her anger came through to her face. She picked up her glass
and touched her lips to it. “Liquor makes me sick,” she said. “I never drink it. It poisons me.” She
shut her mouth tight and her sharp teeth bit down on her lower lip.
Adam continued to smile at her.
Her rage was rising beyond her control. She tossed the rum down her throat and coughed, and her
eyes watered and she wiped her tears away with the back of her hand. “You don’t trust me very
much,” she said.
“No, I don’t.” He raised his glass and drank his rum, then got up and filled both glasses.
“I will not drink any more,” she said in panic.
“You don’t have to,” Adam said. “I’ll just finish this and go along.”
The biting alcohol burned in her throat and she felt the stirring in her that frightened her. “I’m not
afraid of you or anyone else,” she said, and she drank off her second glass.
“You haven’t any reason to be afraid of me,” said Adam. “You can forget me now. But you said
you had already.” He felt gloriously warm and safe, better than he had for many years. “I came
up to Sam Hamilton’s funeral,” he said. “That was a fine man. I’ll miss him. Do you remember,
Cathy, he helped you with the twins?”
In Kate the liquor raged. She fought and the strain of the fight showed on her face.
“What’s the matter?” Adam asked.
“I told you it poisoned me. I told you it made me sick.”
“I couldn’t take the chance,” he calmly said. “You shot me once. I don’t know what else you’ve
done.”
“What do you mean?”
“I’ve heard some scandal,” he said. “Just dirty scan-dal.”
For the moment she had forgotten her will-fight against the cruising alcohol, and now she had

lost the battle. The redness was up in her brain and her fear was gone and in its place was cruelty
without caution. She snatched the bottle and filled her glass.
Adam had to get up to pour his own. A feeling completely foreign to him had arisen. He was
enjoying what he saw in her. He liked to see her struggling. He felt good about punishing her, but
he was also watch-ful. “Now I must be careful,” he told himself. “Don’t talk, don’t talk.”
He said aloud, “Sam Hamilton has been a good friend to me all the years. I’ll miss him.”
She had spilled some rum, and it moistened the corners of her mouth. “I hated him,” she said. “I
would have killed him if I could.”
“Why? He was kind to us.”
“He looked—he looked into me.”
“Why not? He looked into me too, and he helped me.”
“I hate him,” she said. “I’m glad he’s dead.”
“Might have been good if I had looked into you,” Adam said.
Her lip curled. “You are a fool,” she said. “I don’t hate you. You’re just a weak fool.”
As her tension built up, a warm calm settled on Adam.
“Sit there and grin,” she cried. “You think you’re free, don’t you? A few drinks and you think
you’re a man! I could crook my little finger and you’d come back slobbering, crawling on your
knees.” Her sense of power was loose and her vixen carefulness abandoned. “I know you,” she
said. “I know your cowardly heart.”
Adam went on smiling. He tasted his drink, and that reminded her to pour another for herself. The
bottle neck chattered against her glass.
“When I was hurt I needed you,” she said. “But you were slop. And when I didn’t need you any
more you tried to stop me. Take that ugly smirk off your face.”
“I wonder what it is you hate so much.”
“You wonder, do you?” Her caution was almost en-tirely gone. “It isn’t hatred, it’s contempt.
When I was a little girl I knew what stupid lying fools they were—my own mother and father
pretending goodness. And they weren’t good. I knew them. I could make them do whatever I
wanted. I could always make people do what I wanted. When I was half-grown I made a man kill
himself. He pretended to be good too, and all he wanted was to go to bed with me—a little girl.”
“But you say he killed himself. He must have been very sorry about something.”
“He was a fool,” said Kate. “I heard him come to the door and beg. I laughed all night.”
Adam said, “I wouldn’t like to think I’d driven anybody out of the world.”
“You’re a fool too. I remember how they talked. ‘Isn’t she a pretty little thing, so sweet, so
dainty?’ And no one knew me. I made them jump through hoops, and they never knew it.”
Adam drained his glass. He felt remote and inspective. He thought he could see her impulses
crawling like ants and could read them. The sense of deep under-standing that alcohol sometimes
gives was on him. He said, “It doesn’t matter whether you liked Sam Hamil-ton. I found him
wise. I remember he said one time that a woman who knows all about men usually knows one
part very well and can’t conceive the other parts, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there.”
“He was a liar and a hypocrite too.” Kate spat out her words. “That’s what I hate, the liars, and

they’re all liars. That’s what it is. I love to show them up. I love to rub their noses in their own
nastiness.”
Adam’s brows went up. “Do you mean that in the whole world there’s only evil and folly?”
“That’s exactly what I mean.”
“I don’t believe it,” Adam said quietly.
“You don’t believe it! You don’t believe it!” She mimicked him. “Would you like me to prove
it?”
“You can’t,” he said.
She jumped up, ran to her desk, and brought the brown envelopes to the table. “Take a look at
those,” she said.
“I don’t want to.”
“I’ll show you anyway.” She took out a photograph. “Look there. That’s a state senator. He
thinks he’s going to run for Congress. Look at his fat stomach. He’s got bubs like a woman. He
likes whips. That streak there—that’s a whip mark. Look at the expres-sion on his face! He’s got
a wife and four kids and he’s going to run for Congress. You don’t believe! Look at this! This
piece of white blubber is a councilman; this big red Swede has a ranch out near Blanco. Look
here! This is a professor at Berkeley. Comes all the way down here to have the toilet splashed in
his face—professor of philosophy. And look at this! This is a minister of the Gospel, a little
brother of Jesus. He used to burn a house down to get what he wanted. We give it to him now
another way. See that lighted match under his skinny flank?”
“I don’t want to see these,” said Adam.
“Well, you have seen them. And you don’t believe it! I’ll have you begging to get in here. I’ll
have you screaming at the moon.” She tried to force her will on him, and she saw that he was
detached and free. Her rage congealed to poison. “No one has ever escaped,” she said softly. Her
eyes were flat and cold but her fingernails were tearing at the upholstery of the chair, ripping and
fraying the silk.
Adam sighed. “If I had those pictures and those men knew it, I wouldn’t think my life was very
safe,” he said. “I guess one of those pictures could destroy a man’s whole life. Aren’t you in
danger?”
“Do you think I’m a child?” she asked.
“Not any more,” said Adam. “I’m beginning to think you’re a twisted human—or no human at
all.”
She smiled. “Maybe you’ve struck it,” she said. “Do you think I want to be human? Look at those
pictures! I’d rather be a dog than a human. But I’m not a dog. I’m smarter than humans. Nobody
can hurt me. Don’t worry about danger.” She waved at the filing cabinets. “I have a hundred
beautiful pictures in there, and those men know that if anything should happen to me—anything—
one hundred letters, each one with a picture, would be dropped in the mail, and each letter will go
where it will do the most harm. No, they won’t hurt me.”
Adam asked, “But suppose you had an accident, or maybe a disease?”
“That wouldn’t make any difference,” she said. She leaned closer to him. “I’m going to tell you a

secret none of those men knows. In a few years I’ll be going away. And when I do—those
envelopes will be dropped in the mail anyway.” She leaned back in her chair, laughing.
Adam shivered. He looked closely at her. Her face and her laughter were childlike and innocent.
He got up and poured himself another drink, a short drink. The bottle was nearly empty. “I know
what you hate. You hate something in them you can’t understand. You don’t hate their evil. You
hate the good in them you can’t get at. I wonder what you want, what final thing.”
“I’ll have all the money I need,” she said. “I’ll go to New York and I won’t be old. I’m not old.
I’ll buy a house, a nice house in a nice neighborhood, and I’ll have nice servants. And first I will
find a man, if he’s still alive, and very slowly and with the greatest atten-tion to pain I will take
his life away. If I do it well and carefully, he will go crazy before he dies.”
Adam stamped on the floor impatiently. “Nonsense,” he said. “This isn’t true. This is crazy. None
of this is true. I don’t believe any of it.”
She said, “Do you remember when you first saw me?”
His face darkened. “Oh, Lord, yes!”
“You remember my broken jaw and my split lips and my missing teeth?”
“I remember. I don’t want to remember.”
“My pleasure will be to find the man who did that,” she said. “And after that—there will be other
plea-sures.”
“I have to go,” Adam said.
She said, “Don’t go, dear. Don’t go now, my love. My sheets are silk. I want you to feel those
sheets against your skin.”
“You don’t mean that?”
“Oh, I do, my love. I do. You aren’t clever at love, but I can teach you. I will teach you.” She
stood up unsteadily and laid her hand on his arm. Her face seemed fresh and young. Adam looked
down at her hand and saw it wrinkled as a pale monkey’s paw. He moved away in revulsion.
She saw his gesture and understood it and her mouth hardened.
“I don’t understand,” he said. “I know, but I can’t believe. I know I won’t believe it in the
morning. It will be a nightmare dream. But no, it—it can’t be a dream—no. Because I remember
you are the mother of my boys. You haven’t asked about them. You are the mother of my sons.”
Kate put her elbows on her knees and cupped her hands under her chin so that her fingers covered
her pointed ears. Her eyes were bright with triumph. Her voice was mockingly soft. “A fool
always leaves an opening,” she said. “I discovered that when I was a child. I am the mother of
your sons. Your sons? I am the mother, yes—but how do you know you are the father?”
Adam’s mouth dropped open. “Cathy, what do you mean?”
“My name is Kate,” she said. “Listen, my darling, and remember. How many times did I let you
come near enough to me to have children?”
“You were hurt,” he said. “You were terribly hurt.”
“Once,” said Kate, “just once.”
“The pregnancy made you ill,” he protested. “It was hard on you.”
She smiled at him sweetly. “I wasn’t too hurt for your brother.”

“My brother?”
“Have you forgotten Charles?”
Adam laughed. “You are a devil,” he said. “But do you think I could believe that of my brother?”
“I don’t care what you believe,” she said.
Adam said, “I don’t believe it.”
“You will. At first you will wonder, and then you’ll be unsure. You’ll think back about Charles—
all about him. I could have loved Charles. He was like me in a way.”
“He was not.”
“You’ll remember,” she said. “Maybe one day you will remember some tea that tasted bitter. You
took my medicine by mistake—remember? Slept as you had never slept before and awakened late
—thick-headed?”
“You were too hurt to plan a thing like that.”
“I can do anything,” she said. “And now, my love, take off your clothes. And I will show you
what else I can do.”
Adam closed his eyes and his head reeled with the rum. He opened his eyes and shook his head
violently. “It wouldn’t matter—even if it were true,” he said. “It wouldn’t matter at all.” And
suddenly he laughed be-cause he knew that this was so. He stood too quickly and had to grab the
back of his chair to steady himself against dizziness.
Kate leaped up and put both of her hands on his elbow. “Let me help you take off your coat.”
Adam twisted her hands from his arm as though they were wire. He moved unsteadily toward the
door.
Uncontrolled hatred shone in Kate’s eyes. She screamed, a long and shrill animal screech. Adam
stopped and turned toward her. The door banged open. The house pimp took three steps, poised,
pivoted with his whole weight, and his fist struck Adam under the ear. Adam crashed to the floor.
Kate screamed, “The boots! Give him the boots!” Ralph moved closer to the fallen man and
measured the distance. He noticed Adam’s open eyes staring up at him. He turned nervously to
Kate.
Her voice was cold. “I said give him the boots. Break his face!”
Ralph said, “He ain’t fighting back. The fight’s all out of him.”
Kate sat down. She breathed through her mouth. Her hands writhed in her lap. “Adam,” she said,
“I hate you. I hate you now for the first time. I hate you! Adam, are you listening? I hate you!”
Adam tried to sit up, fell back, and tried again. Sitting on the floor, he looked up at Kate. “It
doesn’t matter,” he said. “It doesn’t matter at all.”
He got to his knees and rested with his knuckles against the floor. He said, “Do you know, I
loved you better than anything in the world? I did. It was so strong that it took quite a killing.”
“You’ll come crawling back,” she said. “You’ll drag your belly on the floor—begging, begging!”
“You want the boots now, Miss Kate?” Ralph asked.
She did not answer.
Adam moved very slowly toward the door, balancing his steps carefully. His hand fumbled at the
doorjamb.

Kate called, “Adam!”
He turned slowly. He smiled at her as a man might smile at a memory. Then he went out and
closed the door gently behind him.
Kate sat staring at the door. Her eyes were desolate.

Chapter 26
1
On the train back to King City from his trip to Salinas, Adam Trask was in a cloud of vague
forms and sounds and colors. He was not conscious of any thought at all.
I believe there are techniques of the human mind whereby, in its dark deep, problems are
examined, rejected or accepted. Such activities sometimes concern facets a man does not know he
has. How often one goes to sleep troubled and full of pain, not knowing what causes the travail,
and in the morning a whole new direction and a clearness is there, maybe the result of the black
reasoning. And again there are mornings when ecstasy bubbles in the blood, and the stomach and
chest are tight and electric with joy, and nothing in the thoughts to justify it or cause it.
Samuel’s funeral and the talk with Kate should have made Adam sad and bitter, but they did not.
Out of the gray throbbing an ecstasy arose. He felt young and free and filled with a hungry gaiety.
He got off the train in King City, and, instead of going directly to the livery stable to claim his
horse and buggy, he walked to Will Hamilton’s new garage.
Will was sitting in his glass-walled office from which he could watch the activity of his
mechanics without hearing the clamor of their work. Will’s stomach was beginning to fill out
richly.
He was studying an advertisement for cigars shipped direct and often from Cuba. He thought he
was mourn-ing for his dead father, but he was not. He did have some little worry about Tom, who
had gone directly from the funeral to San Francisco. He felt that it was more dignified to lose
oneself in business, as he intended to do, than in alcohol, as Tom was probably doing.
He looked up when Adam came into the office and waved his hand to one of the big leather
chairs he had installed to lull his customers past the size of the bills they were going to have to
pay.
Adam sat down. “I don’t know whether I offered my condolences,” he said.
“It’s a sad time,” said Will. “You were at the fu-neral?”
“Yes,” said Adam. “I don’t know whether you know how I felt about your father. He gave me
things I will never forget.”
“He was respected,” said Will. “There were over two hundred people at the cemetery—over two
hundred.”
“Such a man doesn’t really die,” Adam said, and he was discovering it himself. “I can’t think of
him dead. He seems maybe more alive to me than before.”
“That’s true,” said Will, and it was not true to him. To Will, Samuel was dead.
“I think of things he said,” Adam went on. “When he said them I didn’t listen very closely, but
now they come back, and I can see his face when he said them.”

“That’s true,” said Will. “I was just thinking the same thing. Are you going back to your place?”
“Yes, I am. But I thought I would come in and talk to you about buying an automobile.”
A subtle change came over Will, a kind of silent alertness. “I would have said you’d be the last
man in the valley to get a car,” he observed and watched through half-closed eyes for Adam’s
reaction.
Adam laughed. “I guess I deserved that,” he said. “Maybe your father is responsible for a change
in me.”
“How do you mean?”
“I don’t know as I could explain it. Anyway, let’s talk about a car.”
“I’ll give you the straight dope on it,” said Will. “The truth of the matter is I’m having one hell of
a time getting enough cars to fill my orders. Why, I’ve got a list of people who want them.”
“Is that so? Well, maybe I’ll just have to put my name on the list.”
“I’d be glad to do that, Mr. Trask, and—” He paused. “You’ve been so close to the family that—
well, if there should be a cancellation I’d be glad to move you up on the list.”
“That’s kind of you,” said Adam.
“How would you like to arrange it?”
“How do you mean?”
“Well, I can arrange it so you pay only so much a month.”
“Isn’t it more expensive that way?”
“Well, there’s interest and carrying charge. Some people find it convenient.”
“I think I’ll pay cash,” said Adam. “There’d be no point in putting it off.”
Will chuckled. “Not very many people feel that way,” he said. “And there’s going to come a time
when I won’t be able to sell for cash without losing money.”
“I’d never thought of that,” said Adam. “You will put me on the list though?”
Will leaned toward him. “Mr. Trask, I’m going to put you on the top of the list. The first car that
comes in, you’re going to have.”
“Thank you.”
“I’ll be glad to do it for you,” said Will.
Adam asked, “How is your mother holding up?”
Will leaned back in his chair and an affectionate smile came on his face. “She’s a remarkable
woman,” he said. “She’s like a rock. I think back on all the hard times we had, and we had plenty
of them. My father wasn’t very practical. He was always off in the clouds or buried in a book. I
think my mother held us together and kept the Hamiltons out of the poorhouse.”
“She’s a fine woman,” Adam said.
“Not only fine. She’s strong. She stands on her two feet. She’s a tower of strength. Did you come
back to Olive’s house after the funeral?”
“No, I didn’t.”
“Well over a hundred people did. And my mother fried all that chicken and saw that everybody
had enough.”
“She didn’t!”

“Yes, she did. And when you think—it was her own husband.”
“A remarkable woman,” Adam repeated Will’s phrase.
“She’s practical. She knew they had to be fed and she fed them.”
“I guess she’ll be all right, but it must be a great loss to her.”
“She’ll be all right,” Will said. “And she’ll outlive us all, little tiny thing that she is.”
On his drive back to the ranch Adam found that he was noticing things he had not seen for years.
He saw the wildflowers in the heavy grass, and he saw the red cows against the hillsides, moving
up the easy ascend-ing paths and eating as they went. When he came to his own land Adam felt a
quick pleasure so sharp that he began to examine it. And suddenly he found himself saying aloud
in rhythm with his horse’s trotting feet, “I’m free, I’m free. I don’t have to worry any more. I’m
free. She’s gone. She’s out of me. Oh, Christ Almighty, I’m free!”
He reached out and stripped the fur from the silver-gray sage beside the road, and when his
fingers were sticky with the sap he smelled the sharp penetrating odor on his fingers, breathed it
deep into his lungs. He was glad to be going home. He wanted to see how the twins had grown in
the two days he had been gone—he wanted to see the twins.
“I’m free, she’s gone,” he chanted aloud.

2
Lee came out of the house to meet Adam, and he stood at the horse’s head while Adam climbed
down from the buggy.
“How are the boys?” Adam asked.
“They’re fine. I made them some bows and arrows and they went hunting rabbits in the river
bottom. I’m not keeping the pan hot though.”
“Everything all right here?”
Lee looked at him sharply, was about to exclaim, changed his mind. “How was the funeral?”
“Lots of people,” Adam said. “He had lots of friends. I can’t get it through my head that he’s
gone.”
“My people bury them with drums and scatter pa-pers to confuse the devils and put roast pigs
instead of flowers on the grave. We’re a practical people and al-ways a little hungry. But our
devils aren’t very bright. We can outthink them. That’s some progress.”
“I think Samuel would have liked that kind of funer-al,” said Adam. “It would have interested
him.” He noticed that Lee was staring at him. “Put the horse away, Lee, and then come in and
make some tea. I want to talk to you.”
Adam went into the house and took off his black clothes. He could smell the sweet and now
sickish odor of rum about himself. He removed all of his clothes and sponged his skin with
yellow soap until the odor was gone from his pores. He put on a clean blue shirt and overalls
washed until they were soft and pale blue and lighter blue at the knees where the wear came. He
shaved slowly and combed his hair while the rattle of Lee at the stove sounded from the kitchen.
Then he went to the living room. Lee had set out one cup and a bowl of sugar on the table beside
his big chair. Adam looked around at the flowered curtains washed so long that the blossoms

were pale. He saw the worn rugs on the floor and the brown path on the linoleum in the hall. And
it was all new to him.
When Lee came in with the teapot Adam said, “Bring yourself a cup, Lee. And if you’ve got any
of that drink of yours, I could use a little. I got drunk last night.”
Lee said, “You drunk? I can hardly believe it.”
“Well, I was. And I want to talk about it. I saw you looking at me.”
“Did you?” asked Lee, and he went to the kitchen to bring his cup and glasses and his stone bottle
of ng-ka-py.
He said when he came back, “The only times I’ve tasted it for years have been with you and Mr.
Hamil-ton.”
“Is that the same one we named the twins with?”
“Yes, it is.” Lee poured the scalding green tea. He grimaced when Adam put two spoonfuls of
sugar in his cup.
Adam stirred his tea and watched the sugar crystals whirl and disappear into liquid. He said, “I
went down to see her.”
“I thought you might,” said Lee. “As a matter of fact I don’t see how a human man could have
waited so long.”
“Maybe I wasn’t a human man.”
“I thought of that too. How was she?”
Adam said slowly, “I can’t understand it. I can’t believe there is such a creature in the world.”
“The trouble with you Occidentals is that you don’t have devils to explain things with. Did you
get drunk afterward?”
“No, before and during. I needed it for courage, I guess.”
“You look all right now.”
“I am all right,” said Adam. “That’s what I want to talk to you about.” He paused and said
ruefully, “This time last year I would have run to Sam Hamilton to talk.”
“Maybe both of us have got a piece of him,” said Lee. “Maybe that’s what immortality is.”
“I seemed to come out of a sleep,” said Adam. “In some strange way my eyes have cleared. A
weight is off me.”
“You even use words that sound like Mr. Hamil-ton,” said Lee. “I’ll build a theory for my
immortal relatives.”
Adam drank his cup of black liquor and licked his lips. “I’m free,” he said. “I have to tell it to
someone. I can live with my boys. I might even see a woman. Do you know what I’m saying?”
“Yes, I know. And I can see it in your eyes and in the way your body stands. A man can’t lie
about a thing like that. You’ll like the boys, I think.”
“Well, at least I’m going to give myself a chance. Will you give me another drink and some more
tea?”
Lee poured the tea and picked up his cup.
“I don’t know why you don’t scald your mouth, drinking it that hot.”
Lee was smiling inwardly. Adam, looking at him, realized that Lee was not a young man any

more. The skin on his cheeks was stretched tight, and its surface shone as though it were glazed.
And there was a red irritated rim around his eyes.
Lee studied the shell-thin cup in his hand and his was a memory smile. “Maybe if you’re free,
you can free me.”
“What do you mean, Lee?”
“Could you let me go?”
“Why, of course you can go. Aren’t you happy here?”
“I don’t think I’ve ever known what you people call happiness. We think of contentment as the
desirable thing, and maybe that’s negative.”
Adam said, “Call it that then. Aren’t you contented here?”
Lee said, “I don’t think any man is contented when there are things undone he wishes to do.”
“What do you want to do?”
“Well, one thing it’s too late for. I wanted to have a wife and sons of my own. Maybe I wanted to
hand down the nonsense that passes for wisdom in a parent, to force it on my own helpless
children.”
“You’re not too old.”
“Oh, I guess I’m physically able to father a child. That’s not what I’m thinking. I’m too closely
married to a quiet reading lamp. You know, Mr. Trask, once I had a wife. I made her up just as
you did, only mine had no life outside my mind. She was good company in my little room. I
would talk and she would listen, and then she would talk, would tell me all the happenings of a
woman’s afternoon. She was very pretty and she made coquettish little jokes. But now I don’t
know whether I would listen to her. And I wouldn’t want to make her sad or lonely. So there’s
my first plan gone.”
“What was the other?”
“I talked to Mr. Hamilton about that. I want to open a bookstore in Chinatown in San Francisco. I
would live in the back, and my days would be full of discus-sions and arguments. I would like to
have in stock some of those dragon-carved blocks of ink from the dynasty of Sung. The boxes are
worm-bored, and that ink is made from fir smoke and a glue that comes only from wild asses’
skin. When you paint with that ink it may physically be black but it suggests to your eye and
persuades your seeing that it is all the colors in the world. Maybe a painter would come by and
we could argue about method and haggle about price.”
Adam said, “Are you making this up?”
“No. If you are well and if you are free, I would like to have my little bookshop at last. I would
like to die there.”
Adam sat silently for a while, stirring sugar into his lukewarm tea. Then he said, “Funny. I found
myself wishing you were a slave so I could refuse you. Of course you can go if you want to. I’ll
even lend you money for your bookstore.”
“Oh, I have the money. I’ve had it a long time.”
“I never thought of your going,” Adam said. “I took you for granted.” He straightened his
shoulders. “Could you wait a little while?”

“What for?”
“I want you to help me get acquainted with my boys. I want to put this place in shape, or maybe
sell it or rent it. I’ll want to know how much money I have left and what I can do with it.”
“You wouldn’t lay a trap for me?” Lee asked. “My wish isn’t as strong as it once was. I’m afraid
I could be talked out of it or, what would be worse, I could be held back just by being needed.
Please try not to need me. That’s the worst bait of all to a lonely man.”
Adam said, “A lonely man. I must have been far down in myself not to have thought of that.”
“Mr. Hamilton knew,” said Lee. He raised his head and his fat lids let only two sparks from his
eyes show through. “We’re controlled, we Chinese,” he said. “We show no emotion. I loved Mr.
Hamilton. I would like to go to Salinas tomorrow if you will permit it.”
“Do anything you want,” said Adam. “God knows you’ve done enough for me.”
“I want to scatter devil papers,” Lee said. “I want to put a little roast pig on the grave of my
father.”
Adam got up quickly and knocked over his cup and went outside and left Lee sitting there.

Chapter 27
1
That year the rains had come so gently that the Salinas River did not overflow. A slender stream
twisted back and forth in its broad bed of gray sand, and the water was not milky with silt but
clear and pleasant. The willows that grow in the river bed were well leafed, and the wild
blackberry vines were thrusting their spiky new shoots along the ground.
It was very warm for March, and the kite wind blew steadily from the south and turned up the
silver under-sides of the leaves.
Against the perfect cover of vine and bramble and tangled drift sticks, a little gray brush rabbit sat
quietly in the sun, drying his breast fur, wet by the grass dew of his early feeding. The rabbit’s
nose crinkled, and his ears slewed around now and then, investigating small sounds that might
possibly be charged with danger to a brush rabbit. There had been a rhythmic vibration in the
ground audible through the paws, so that ears swung and nose wrinkled, but that had stopped.
Then there had been a movement of willow branches twen-ty-five years away and downwind, so
that no odor of fear came to the rabbit.
For the last two minutes there had been sounds of interest but not of danger—a snap and then a
whistle like that of the wings of a wild dove. The rabbit stretched out one hind leg lazily in the
warm sun. There was a snap and a whistle and a grunting thud on fur. The rabbit sat perfectly still
and his eyes grew large. A bamboo arrow was through his chest, and its iron tip deep in the
ground on the other side. The rabbit slumped over on his side and his feet ran and scam-pered in
the air for a moment before he was still.
From the willow two crouching boys crept. They carried four-foot bows, and tufts of arrows
stuck their feathers up from the quivers behind their left shoul-ders. They were dressed in overalls
and faded blue shirts, but each boy wore one perfect turkey tailfeather tied with tape against his
temple.
The boys moved cautiously, bending low, self-consciously toeing-in like Indians. The rabbit’s
flutter of death was finished when they bent over to examine their victim.
“Right through the heart,” said Cal as though it could not be any other way. Aron looked down
and said nothing. “I’m going to say you did it,” Cal went on. “I won’t take credit. And I’ll say it
was a hard shot.”
“Well, it was,” said Aron.
“Well, I’m telling you. I’ll give you credit to Lee and to Father.”
“I don’t know as I want credit—not all of it,” said Aron. “Tell you what. If we get another one
we’ll say we each hit one, and if we don’t get any more, why don’t we say we both shot together
and we don’t know who hit?”

“Don’t you want credit?” Cal asked subtly.
“Well, not full credit. We could divide it up.”
“After all, it was my arrow,” said Cal.
“No, it wasn’t.”
“You look at the feathers. See that nick? That’s mine.”
“How did it get in my quiver? I don’t remember any nick.”
“Maybe you don’t remember. But I’m going to give you credit anyway.”
Aron said gratefully, “No, Cal. I don’t want that. We’ll say we both shot at once.”
“Well, if that’s what you want. But suppose Lee sees it was my arrow?”
“We’ll just say it was in my quiver.”
“You think he’ll believe that? He’ll think you’re lying.”
Aron said helplessly, “If he thinks you shot it, why, we’ll just let him think that.”
“I just wanted you to know,” said Cal. “Just in case he’d think that.” He drew the arrow through
the rabbit so that the white feathers were dark red with heart blood. He put the arrow in his
quiver. “You can carry him,” he said magnanimously.
“We ought to start back,” said Aron. “Maybe Father is back by now.”
Cal said, “We could cook that old rabbit and have him for our supper and stay out all night.”
“It’s too cold at night, Cal. Don’t you remember how you shivered this morning?”
“It’s not too cold for me,” said Cal. “I never feel cold.”
“You did this morning.”
“No, I didn’t. I was just making fun of you, shiver-ing and chattering like a milk baby. Do you
want to call me a liar?”
“No,” said Aron. “I don’t want to fight.”
“Afraid to fight?”
“No. I just don’t want to.”
“If I was to say you was scared, would you want to call me a liar?”
“No.”
“Then you’re scared, aren’t you?”
“I guess so.”
Aron wandered slowly away, leaving the rabbit on the ground. His eyes were very wide and he
had a beautiful soft mouth. The width between his blue eyes gave him an expression of angelic
innocence. His hair was fine and golden. The sun seemed to light up the top of his head.
He was puzzled—but he was often puzzled. He knew his brother was getting at something, but he
didn’t know what. Cal was an enigma to him. He could not follow the reasoning of his brother,
and he was always surprised at the tangents it took.
Cal looked more like Adam. His hair was dark brown. He was bigger than his brother, bigger of
bone, heavier in the shoulder, and his jaw had the square sternness of Adam’s jaw. Cal’s eyes
were brown and watchful, and sometimes they sparkled as though they were black. But Cal’s
hands were very small for the size of the rest of him. The fingers were short and slender, the nails
delicate. Cal protected his hands. There were few things that could make him cry, but a cut finger

was one of them. He never ventured with his hands, never touched an insect or carried a snake
about. And in a fight he picked up a rock or a stick to fight with.
As Cal watched his brother walking away from him there was a small sure smile on his lips. He
called, “Aron, wait for me!”
When he caught up with his brother he held out the rabbit. “You can carry it,” he said kindly,
putting his arm around his brother’s shoulders. “Don’t be mad with me.”
“You always want to fight,” said Aron.
“No, I don’t. I was only making a joke.”
“Were you?”
“Sure. Look—you can carry the rabbit. And we’ll start back now if you want.”
Aron smiled at last. He was always relieved when his brother let the tension go. The two boys
trudged up out of the river bottom and up the crumbling cliff to the level land. Aron’s right
trouser leg was well bloodied from the rabbit.
Cal said, “They’ll be surprised we got a rabbit. If Father’s home, let’s give it to him. He likes a
rabbit for his supper.”
“All right,” Aron said happily. “Tell you what. We’ll both give it to him and we won’t say which
one hit it.”
“All right, if you want to,” said Cal.
They walked along in silence for a time and then Cal said, “All this is our land—way to hell over
the river.”
“It’s Father’s.”
“Yes, but when he dies it’s going to be ours.”
This was a new thought to Aron. “What do you mean, when he dies?”
“Everybody dies,” said Cal. “Like Mr. Hamilton. He died.”
“Oh, yes,” Aron said. “Yes, he died.” He couldn’t connect the two—the dead Mr. Hamilton and
the live father.
“They put him in a box and then they dig a hole and put the box in,” said Cal.
“I know that.” Aron wanted to change the subject, to think of something else.
Cal said, “I know a secret.”
“What is it?”
“You’d tell.”
“No, I wouldn’t, if you said not.”
“I don’t know if I ought.”
“Tell me,” Aron begged.
“You won’t tell?”
“No, I won’t.”
Cal said, “Where do you think our mother is?”
“She’s dead.”
“No, she isn’t.”
“She is too.”

“She ran away,” said Cal. “I heard some men talk-ing.”
“They were liars.”
“She ran away,” said Cal. “You won’t tell I told you?”
“I don’t believe it,” said Aron. “Father said she was in Heaven.”
Cal said quietly, “Pretty soon I’m going to run away and find her. I’ll bring her back.”
“Where did the men. say she is?”
“I don’t know, but I’ll find her.”
“She’s in Heaven,” said Aron. “Why would Father tell a lie?” He looked at his brother, begging
him silently to agree. Cal didn’t answer him. “Don’t you think she’s in Heaven with the angels?”
Aron insisted. And when Cal still did not answer, “Who were the men who said it?”
“Just some men. In the post office at King City. They didn’t think I could hear. But I got good
ears. Lee says I can hear the grass grow.”
Aron said, “What would she want to run away for?”
“How do I know? Maybe she didn’t like us.”
Aron inspected this heresy. “No,” he said. “The men were liars. Father said she’s in Heaven. And
you know how he don’t like to talk about her.”
“Maybe that’s because she ran away.”
“No. I asked Lee. Know what Lee said? Lee said, ‘Your mother loved you and she still does.’
And Lee gave me a star to look at. He said maybe that was our mother and she would love us as
long as that light was there. Do you think Lee is a liar?” Through his gather-ing tears Aron could
see his brother’s eyes, hard and reasonable. There were no tears in Cal’s eyes.
Cal felt pleasantly excited. He found another imple-ment, another secret tool, to use for any
purpose he needed. He studied Aron, saw his quivering lips, but he noticed in time the flaring
nostrils. Aron would cry, but sometimes, pushed to tears, Aron would fight too. And when Aron
cried and fought at the same time he was dangerous. Nothing could hurt him and nothing could
stop him. Once Lee had held him in his lap, clasping his still flailing fists to his sides, until after a
long time he relaxed. And his nostrils had flared then.
Cal put his new tool away. He could bring it out anytime, and he knew it was the sharpest
weapon he had found. He would inspect it at his ease and judge just when and how much to use it.
He made his decision almost too late. Aron leaped at him and the limp body of the rabbit slashed
against his face. Cal jumped back and cried, “I was just joking. Honest, Aron, it was only a joke.”
Aron stopped. Pain and puzzlement were on his face. “I don’t like that joke,” he said, and he
sniffled and wiped his nose on his sleeve.
Cal came close to him and hugged him and kissed him on the cheek. “I won’t do it any more,” he
said.
The boys trudged along silently for a while. The light of day began to withdraw. Cal looked over
his shoulder at a thunderhead sailing blackly over the mountains on the nervous March wind.
“Going to storm,” he said. “Going to be a bastard.” Aron said, “Did you really hear those men?”
“Maybe I only thought I did,” Cal said quickly. “Jesus, look at that cloud!”
Aron turned around to look at the black monster. It ballooned in great dark rolls above, and

beneath it drew a long trailing skirt of rain, and as they looked the cloud rumbled and flashed fire.
Borne on the wind, the cloudburst drummed hollowly on the fat wet hills across the valley and
moved out over the flat lands. The boys turned and ran for home, and the cloud boomed at their
backs and the lightning shattered the air into quaking pieces. The cloud caught up with them, and
the first stout drops plopped on the ground out of the riven sky. They could smell the sweet odor
of ozone. Running, they sniffed the thunder smell.
As they raced across the country road and onto the wheel tracks that led to their own home draw
the water struck them. The rain fell in sheets and in columns. Instantly they were soaked through,
and their hair plas-tered down on their foreheads and streamed into their eyes, and the turkey
feathers at their temples bent over with the weight of water.
Now that they were as wet as they could get the boys stopped running. There was no reason to
run for cover. They looked at each other and laughed for joy. Aron wrung out the rabbit and
tossed it in the air and caught it and threw it to Cal. And Cal, feeling silly, put it around his neck
with the head and hind feet under his chin. Both boys leaned over and laughed hysterically. The
rain roared on the oak trees in the home draw and the wind disturbed their high dignity.

2
The twins came in sight of the ranch buildings in time to see Lee, his head through the center
hole of a yellow oilskin poncho, leading a strange horse and a flimsy rubber-tired buggy toward
the shed. “Somebody’s here,” said Cal. “Will you look at that rig?”
They began to run again, for there was a certain deliciousness about visitors. Near the steps they
slowed down, moved cautiously around the house, for there was a certain fearsomeness about
visitors too. They went in the back way and stood dripping in the kitch-en. They heard voices in
the living room—their father’s voice and another, a man’s voice. And then a third voice stiffened
their stomachs and rippled a little chill up their spines. It was a woman’s voice. These boys had
had very little experience with women. They tip-toed into their own room and stood looking at
each other.
“Who do you ’spose it is?” Cal asked.
An emotion like a light had burst in Aron. He wanted to shout, “Maybe it’s our mother. Maybe
she’s come back.” And then he remembered that she was in Heav-en and people do not come
back from there. He said, “I don’t know. I’m going to put on dry clothes.”
The boys put on dry clean clothes, which were exact replicas of the sopping clothes they were
taking off. They took off the wet turkey feathers and combed their hair back with their fingers.
And all the while they could hear the voices, mostly low pitched, and then the high woman’s
voice, and once they froze, listening, for they heard a child’s voice—a girl’s voice—and this was
such an excitement that they did not even speak of hearing it.
Silently they edged into the hall and crept toward the door to the living room. Cal turned the
doorknob very, very slowly and lifted it up so that no creak would betray them.
Only the smallest crack was open when Lee came in the back door, shuffled along the hall,
getting out of his poncho, and caught them there. “Lilly boy peek?” he said in pidgin, and when

Cal closed the door and the latch clicked Lee said quickly, “Your father’s home. You’d better go
in.”
Aron whispered hoarsely, “Who else is there?”
“Just some people going by. The rain drove them in.” Lee put his hand over Cal’s on the
doorknob and turned it and opened the door.
“Boys come long home,” he said and left them there, exposed in the opening.
Adam cried, “Come in, boys! Come on in!”
The two carried their heads low and darted glances at the strangers and shuffled their feet. There
was a man in city clothes and a woman in the fanciest clothes ever. Her duster and hat and veil
lay on a chair beside her, and she seemed to the boys to be clad entirely in black silk and lace.
Black lace even climbed up little sticks and hugged her throat. That was enough for one day, but
it wasn’t all. Beside the woman sat a girl, a little younger maybe than the twins, but not much.
She wore a blue-checked sunbonnet with lace around the front. Her dress was flowery, and a little
apron with pockets was tied around her middle. Her skirt was turned back, showing a petticoat of
red knitted yarn with tatting around the edge. The boys could not see her face because of the
sunbonnet, but her hands were folded in her lap, and it was easy to see the little gold seal ring she
wore on her third finger.
Neither boy had drawn a breath and the red rings were beginning to flare in back of their eyes
from holding their breath.
“These are my boys,” their father said. “They’re twins. That’s Aron and this is Caleb. Boys,
shake hands with our guests.”
The boys moved forward, heads down, hands up, in a gesture very like surrender and despair.
Their limp fins were pumped by the gentleman and then by the lacy lady. Aron was first, and he
turned away from the little girl, but the lady said, “Aren’t you going to say how do to my
daughter?”
Aron shuddered and surrendered his hand in the direction of the girl with the hidden face.
Nothing happened. His lifeless sausages were not gripped, or wrung, or squeezed, or racheted.
His hand simply hung in the air in front of her. Aron peeked up through his eyelashes to see what
was going on.
Her head was down too, and she had the advantage of the sunbonnet. Her small right hand with
the signet ring on the middle finger was stuck out too, but it made no move toward Aron’s hand.
He stole a glance at the lady. She was smiling, her lips parted. The room seemed crushed with
silence. And then Aron heard a ripping snicker from Cal.
Aron reached out and grabbed her hand and pumped it up and down three times. It was as soft as
a handful of petals. He felt a pleasure that burned him. He dropped her hand and concealed his in
his overall pocket. As he backed hastily away he saw Cal step up and shake hands formally and
say, “How do.” Aron had forgotten to say it, so he said it now, after his brother, and it sounded
strange. Adam and his guests laughed.
Adam said, “Mr. and Mrs. Bacon nearly got caught in the rain.”
“We were lucky to be lost here,” Mr. Bacon said. “I was looking for the Long ranch.”

“That’s farther. You should have taken the next left turn off the county road to the south.” Adam
contin-ued to the boys, “Mr. Bacojti is a county supervisor.”
“I don’t know why, but I take the job very serious-ly,” said Mr. Bacon, and he too addressed the
boys. “My daughter’s name is Abra, boys. Isn’t that a funny name?” He used the tone adults
employ with children. He turned to Adam and said in poetic singsong, “ ‘Abra was ready ere I
called her name; And though I called another, Abra came.’ Matthew Prior. I won’t say I hadn’t
wanted a son—but Abra’s such a comfort. Look up, dear.”
Abra did not move. Her hands were again clasped in her lap. Her father repeated with relish, “
‘And though I called another, Abra came.’ ”
Aron saw his brother looking at the little sunbonnet without an ounce of fear. And Aron said
hoarsely, “I don’t think Abra’s a funny name.”
“He didn’t mean funny that way,” Mrs. Bacon ex-plained. “He only meant curious.” And she
explained to Adam, “My husband gets the strangest things out of books. Dear, shouldn’t we be
going?”
Adam said eagerly, “Oh, don’t go yet, ma’am. Lee is making some tea. It will warm you up.”
“Well, how pleasant!” Mrs. Bacon said, and she continued, “Children, it isn’t raining any more.
Go outside and play.” Her voice had such authority that they filed out—Aron first and Cal second
and Abra following.

3
In the living room Mr. Bacon crossed his legs. “You have a fine prospect here,” he said. “Is it a
sizable piece?”
Adam said, “I have a good strip. I cross the river to the other side. It’s a good piece.”
“That’s all yours across the county road then?”
“Yes, it is. I’m kind of ashamed to admit it. I’ve let it go badly. I haven’t farmed it at all. Maybe I
got too much farming as a child.”
Both Mr. and Mrs. Bacon were looking at Adam now, and he knew he had to make some
explanation for letting his good land run free. He said, “I guess I’m a lazy man. And my father
didn’t help me when he left me enough to get along on without working.” He dropped his eyes
but he could feel the relief on the part of the Bacons. It was not laziness if he was a rich man.
Only the poor were lazy. Just as only the poor were ignorant. A rich man who didn’t know
anything was spoiled or independent.
“Who takes care of the boys?” Mrs. Bacon asked.
Adam laughed. “What taking care of they get, and it isn’t much, is Lee’s work.”
“Lee?”
Adam became a little irritated with the questioning. “I only have one man,” he said shortly.
“You mean the Chinese we saw?” Mrs. Bacon was shocked.
Adam smiled at her. She had frightened him at first, but now he was moje comfortable. “Lee
raised the boys, and he has taken care of me,” he said.
“But didn’t they ever have a woman’s care?”

“No, they didn’t.”
“The poor lambs,” she said.
“They’re wild but I guess they’re healthy,” Adam said. “I guess we’ve all gone wild like the land.
But now Lee is going away. I don’t know what we’ll do.”
Mr. Bacon carefully cleared the phlegm from his throat so it wouldn’t be run over by his
pronouncement. “Have you thought about the education of your sons?”
“No—I guess I haven’t thought about it much.”
Mrs. Bacon said, “My husband is a believer in edu-cation.”
“Education is the key to the future,” Mr. Bacon said.
“What kind of education?” asked Adam.
Mr. Bacon went on, “All things come to men who know. Yes, I’m a believer in the torch of
learning.” He leaned close and his voice became confidential. “So long as you aren’t going to
farm your land, why don’t you rent it and move to the county seat—near our good public
schools?”
For just a second Adam thought of saying, “Why don’t you mind your own goddam business?”
but in-stead he asked, “You think that would be a good idea?”
“I think I could get you a good reliable tenant,” Mr. Bacon said. “No reason why you shouldn’t
have some-thing coming in from your land if you don’t live on it.”
Lee made a great stir coming in with the tea. He had heard enough of the tones through the door
to be sure Adam was finding them tiresome. Lee was pretty certain they didn’t like tea, and if
they did, they weren’t likely to favor the kind he had brewed. And when they drank it with
compliments he knew the Bacons had their teeth in something. Lee tried to catch Adam’s eye but
could not. Adam was studying the rug between his feet.
Mrs. Bacon was saying, “My husband has served on his school board for many years—” but
Adam didn’t hear the discussion that followed.
He was thinking of a big globe of the world, sus-pended and swaying from a limb of one of his
oak trees. And for no reason at all that he could make out, his mind leaped to his father, stumping
about on his wooden leg, rapping on his leg for attention with a walking stick. Adam could see
the stern and military face of his father as he forced his sons through drill and made them carry
heavy packs to develop their shoul-ders. Through his memory Mrs. Bacon’s voice droned on.
Adam felt the pack loaded with rocks. He saw Charles’ face grinning sardonically—Charles—the
mean, fierce eyes, the hot temper. Suddenly Adam wanted to see Charles. He would take a trip—
take the boys. He slapped his leg with excitement.
Mr. Bacon paused in his talk. “I beg your pardon?”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Adam said. “I just remembered something I’ve neglected to do.” Both Bacons
were patiently, politely waiting for his explanation. Adam thought, Why not? I’m not running for
supervisor. I’m not on the school board. Why not? He said to his guests, “I just remembered that I
have forgotten to write to my brother for over ten years.” They shud-dered under his statement
and exchanged glances.
Lee had been refilling the teacups. Adam saw his cheeks puff out and heard his happy snort as he

passed to the safety of the hallway. The Bacons didn’t want to comment on the incident. They
wanted to be alone to discuss it.
Lee anticipated that it would be this way. He hurried out to harness up and bring the rubber-tired
buggy to the front door.

When Abra and Cal and Aron went out, they stood side by side on the small covered porch,
looking at the rain splashing and dripping down from the wide-spreading oak trees. The
cloudburst had passed into a distant echoing thunder roll, but it had left a rain determined to go
on for a long time.
Aron said, “That lady told us the rain was stopped.”
Abra answered him wisely. “She didn’t look. When she’s talking she never looks.”
Cal demanded, “How old are you?”
“Ten, going on eleven,” said Abra.
“Ho!” said Cal. “We’re eleven, going on twelve.”
Abra pushed her sunbonnet back. It framed her head like a halo. She was pretty, with dark hair in
two braids. Her little forehead was round and domed, and her brows were level. One day her nose
would be sweet and turned up where now it still was button-form. But two features would be with
her always. Her chin was firm and her mouth was as sweet as a flower and very wide and pink.
Her hazel eyes were sharp and intelli-gent and completely fearless. She looked straight into the
faces of the boys, straight into their eyes, one after the other, and there was no hint of the shyness
she had pretended inside the house.
“I don’t believe you’re twins,” she said. “You don’t look alike.”
“We are too,” said Cal.
“We are too,” said Aron.
“Some twins don’t look alike,” Cal insisted.
“Lots of them don’t,” Aron said. “Lee told us how it is. If the lady has one egg, the twins look
alike. If she has two eggs, they don’t.”
“We’re two eggs,” said Cal.
Abra smiled with amusement at the myths of these country boys. “Eggs,” she said. “Ho! Eggs.”
She didn’t say it loudly or harshly, but Lee’s theory tottered and swayed and then she brought it
crashing down. “Which one of you is fried?” she asked. “And which one is poached?”
The boys exchanged uneasy glances. It was their first experience with the inexorable logic of
women, which is overwhelming even, or perhaps especially, when it is wrong. This was new to
them, exciting and frightening.
Cal said, “Lee is a Chinaman.”
“Oh, well,” said Abra kindly, “why don’t you say so? Maybe you’re china eggs then, like they
put in a nest.” She paused to let her shaft sink in. She saw opposition, struggle, disappear. Abra
had taken control. She was the boss.
Aron suggested, “Let’s go to the old house and play there. It leaks a little but it’s nice.”

They ran under the dripping oaks to the old Sanchez house and plunged in through its open door,
which squeaked restlessly on rusty hinges.
The ’dobe house had entered its second decay. The great sala all along the front was half
plastered, the line of white halfway around and then stopping, just as the workmen had left it over
ten years before. And the deep windows with their rebuilt sashes remained glassless. The new
floor was streaked with water stain, and a clutter of old papers and darkened nail bags with their
nails rusted to prickly balls filled the corner of the room.
As the children stood in the entrance a bat flew from the rear of the house. The gray shape
swooped from side to side and disappeared through the doorway.
The boys conducted Abra through the house—opened closets to show wash basins and toilets and
chan-deliers, still crated and waiting to be installed. A smell of mildew and of wet paper was in
the air. The three children walked on tiptoe, and they did not speak for fear of the echoes from the
walls of the empty house.
Back in the big sala the twins faced their guest. “Do you like it?” Aron asked softly because of
the echo.
“Yee-es,” she admitted hesitantly.
“Sometimes we play here,” Cal said boldly. “You can come here and play with us if you like.”
“I live in Salinas,” Abra said in such a tone that they knew they were dealing with a superior
being who hadn’t time for bumpkin pleasures.
Abra saw that she had crushed their highest treasure, and while she knew the weaknesses of men
she still liked them, and, besides, she was a lady. “Sometimes, when we are driving by, I’ll come
and play with you—a little,” she said kindly, and both boys felt grateful to her.
“I’ll give you my rabbit,” said Cal suddenly. “I was going to give it to my father, but you can
have it.”
“What rabbit?”
“The one we shot today—right through the heart with an arrow. He hardly even kicked.”
Aron looked at him in outrage. “It was my—”
Cal interrupted, “We will let you have it to take home. It’s a pretty big one.”
Abra said, “What would I want with a dirty old rabbit all covered with blood?”
Aron said, “I’ll wash him off and put him in a box and tie him with string, and if you don’t want
to eat him, you can have a funeral when you get time—in Salinas.”
“I go to real funerals,” said Abra. “Went to one yesterday. There was flowers high as this roof.”
“Don’t you want our rabbit?” Aron asked.
Abra looked at his sunny hair, tight-curled now, and at his eyes that seemed near to tears, and she
felt the longing and the itching burn in her chest that is the beginning of love. Also, she wanted to
touch Aron, and she did. She put her hand on his arm and felt him shiver under her fingers. “If
you put it in a box,” she said.
Now that she had got herself in charge, Abra looked around and inspected her conquests. She was
well above vanity now that no male principle threatened her. She felt kindly toward these boys.
She noticed their thin washed-out clothes patched here and there by Lee. She drew on her fairy

tales. “You poor children,” she said, “does your father beat you?”
They shook their heads. They were interested but bewildered.
“Are you very poor?”
“How do you mean?” Cal asked. “Do you sit in the ashes and have to fetch water and faggots?”
“What’s faggots?” Aron asked. She avoided that by continuing. “Poor darlings,” she began, and
she seemed to herself to have a little wand in her hand tipped by a twinkling star. “Does your
wicked stepmother hate you and want to kill you?”
“We don’t have a stepmother,” said Cal. “We don’t have any kind,” said Aron. “Our mother’s
dead.”
His words destroyed the story she was writing but almost immediately supplied her with another.
The wand was gone but she wore a big hat with an ostrich plume and she carried an enormous
basket from which a turkey’s feet protruded.
“Little motherless orphans,” she said sweetly. “I’ll be your mother. I’ll hold you and rock you
and tell you stories.”
“We’re too big,” said Cal. “We’d overset you.”
Abra looked away from his brutality. Aron, she saw, was caught up in her story. His eyes were
smiling and he seemed almost to be rocking in her arms, and she felt again the tug of love for
him. She said pleasantly, “Tell me, did your mother have a nice funeral?”
“We don’t remember,” said Aron. “We were too little.”
“Well, where is she buried? You could put flowers on her grave. We always do that for Grandma
and Uncle Albert.”
“We don’t know,” said Aron.
Cal’s eyes had a new interest, a gleaming interest that was close to triumph. He said naively, “I’ll
ask our father where it is so we can take flowers.”
“I’ll go with you,” said Abra. “I can make a wreath. I’ll show you how.” She noticed that Aron
had not spoken. “Don’t you want to make a wreath?”
“Yes,” he said.
She had to touch him again. She patted his shoulder and then touched his cheek. “Your mama
will like that,” she said. “Even in Heaven they look down and notice. My father says they do. He
knows a poem about it.”
Aron said, “I’ll go wrap up the rabbit. I’ve got the box my pants came in.” He ran out of the old
house. Cal watched him go. He was smiling.
“What are you laughing at?” Abra asked.
“Oh, nothing,” he said. Cal’s eyes stayed on her.
She tried to stare him down. She was an expert at staring down, but Cal did not look away. At the
very first he had felt a shyness, but that was gone now, and the sense of triumph at destroying
Abra’s control made him laugh. He knew she preferred his brother, but that was nothing new to
him. Nearly everyone preferred Aron with his golden hair and the openness that al-lowed his
affection to plunge like a puppy. Cal’s emo-tions hid deep in him and peered out, ready to retreat
or attack. He was starting to punish Abra for liking his brother, and this was nothing new either.

He had done it since he first discovered he could. And secret punish-ment had grown to be almost
a creative thing with him.
Maybe the difference between the two boys can best be described in this way. If Aron should
come upon an anthill in a little clearing in the brush, he would lie on his stomach and watch the
complications of ant life—he would see some of them bringing food in the ant roads and others
carrying the white eggs. He would see how two members of the hill on meeting put their antennas
together and talked. For hours he would lie absorbed in the economy of the ground.
If, on the other hand, Cal came upon the same anthill, he would kick it to pieces and watch while
the frantic ants took care of their disaster. Aron was con-tent to be a part of his world, but Cal
must change it.
Cal did not question the fact that people liked his brother better, but he had developed a means
for making it all right with himself. He planned and waited until one time that admiring person
exposed himself, and then something happened and the victim never knew how or why. Out of
revenge Cal extracted a fluid of power, and out of power, joy. It was the strongest, purest emotion
he knew. Far from disliking Aron, he loved him because he was usually the cause for Cal’s
feelings of triumph. He had forgotten—if he had ever known—that he punished because he
wished he could be loved as Aron was loved. It had gone so far that he preferred what he had to
what Aron had.
Abra had started a process in Cal by touching Aron and by the softness of her voice toward him.
Cal’s reaction was automatic. His brain probed for a weak-ness in Abra, and so clever was he that
he found one almost at once in her words. Some children want to be babies and some want to be
adults. Few are content with their age. Abra wanted to be an adult. She used adult words and
simulated, insofar as she was able, adult attitudes and emotions. She had left babyhood far
behind, and she was not capable yet of being one of the grownups she admired. Cal sensed this,
and it gave him the instrument to knock down her anthill.
He knew about how long it would take his brother to find the box. He could see in his mind what
would happen. Aron would try to wash the blood off the rabbit, and this would take time. Finding
string would take more time, and the careful tying of the bow knots still more time. And
meanwhile Cal knew he was begin-ning to win. He felt Abra’s certainty wavering and he knew
that he could prod it further.
Abra looked away from him at last and said, “What do you stare at a person for?”
Cal looked at her feet and slowly raised his eyes, going over her as coldly as if she were a chair.
This, he knew, could make even an adult nervous.
Abra couldn’t stand it. She said, “See anything green?”
Cal asked, “Do you go to school?”
“Of course I do.”
“What grade?”
“High fifth.”
“How old are you?”
“Going on eleven.”

Cal laughed.
“What’s wrong with that?” she demanded. He didn’t answer her. “Come on, tell me! What’s
wrong with that?” Still no answer. “You think you’re mighty smart,” she said, and when he
continued to laugh at her she said uneasily, “I wonder what’s taking your brother so long. Look,
the rain’s stopped.”
Cal said, “I guess he’s looking around for it.”
“You mean, for the rabbit?”
“Oh, no. He’s got that all right—it’s dead. But maybe he can’t catch the other. It gets away.”
“Catch what? What gets away?”
“He wouldn’t want me to tell,” said Cal. “He wants it to be a surprise. He caught it last Friday. It
bit him too.”
“Whatever are you talking about?”
“You’ll see,” said Cal, “when you open the box. I bet he tells you not to open it right off.” This
was not a guess. Cal knew his brother.
Abra knew she was losing not only the battle but the whole war. She began to hate this boy. In
her mind she went over the deadly retorts she knew and gave them all up in helplessness, feeling
they would have no effect. She retired into silence. She walked out of the door and looked toward
the house where her parents were.
“I think I’ll go back,” she said.
“Wait,” said Cal.
She turned as he came up with her. “What do you want?” she asked coldly.
“Don’t be mad with me,” he said. “You don’t know what goes on here. You should see my
brother’s back.”
His change of pace bewildered her. He never let her get set in an attitude, and he had properly
read her interest in romantic situations. His voice was low and secret. She lowered her voice to
match his.
“What do you mean? What’s wrong with his back?”
“All scars,” said Cal. “It’s the Chinaman.”
She shivered and tensed with interest. “What does he do? Does he beat him?”
“Worse than that,” said Cal.
“Why don’t you tell your father?”
“We don’t dare. Do you know what would happen if we told?”
“No. What?”
He shook his head. “No”—he seemed to think care-fully—“I don’t even dare tell you.”
At that moment Lee came from the shed leading the Bacons’ horse hitched to the high spindly rig
with rubber tires. Mr. and Mrs. Bacon came out of the house and automatically they all looked up
at the sky. Cal said, “I can’t tell you now. The Chinaman would know if I told.”
Mrs. Bacon called, “Abra! Hurry! We’re going.” Lee held the restive horse while Mrs. Bacon
was helped up into the rig.
Aron came dashing around the house, carrying a cardboard box intricately tied with string in

fancy bow knots. He thrust it at Abra. “Here,” he said. “Don’t untie it until you get home.”
Cal saw revulsion on Abra’s face. Her hands shrank away from the box.
“Take it, dear,” her father said. “Hurry, we’re very late.” He thrust the box into her hands.
Cal stepped close to her. “I want to whisper,” he said. He put his mouth to her ear. “You’ve wet
your pants,” he said. She blushed and pulled the sunbonnet up over her head. Mrs. Bacon picked
her up under the arms and passed her into the buggy.
Lee and Adam and the twins watched the horse pick up a fine trot.
Before the first turn Abra’s hand came up and the box went sailing backward into the road. Cal
watched his brother’s face and saw misery come into Aron’s eyes. When Adam had gone back
into the house and Lee was moving out with a pan of grain to feed the chickens, Cal put his arm
around his brother’s shoulders and hugged him reassuringly.
“I wanted to marry her,” Aron said. “I put a letter in the box, asking her.”
“Don’t be sad,” said Cal. “I’m going to let you use my rifle.”
Aron’s head jerked around. “You haven’t got a rifle.”
“Haven’t I?” Cal said. “Haven’t I though?”

Chapter 28
1
It was at the supper table that the boys discovered the change in their father. They knew him as a
presence—as ears that heard but did not listen, eyes that looked and did not notice. He was a
cloud of a father. The boys had never learned to tell him of their interests and discoveries, or of
their needs. Lee had been their con-tact with the adult world, and Lee had managed not only to
raise, feed, clothe, and discipline the boys, but he had also given them a respect for their father.
He was a mystery to the boys, and his word, his law, was carried down by Lee, who naturally
made it up himself and ascribed it to Adam.
This night, the first after Adam’s return from Salinas, Cal and Aron were first astonished and then
a little embarrassed to find that Adam listened to them and asked questions, looked at them and
saw them. The change made them timid.
Adam said, “I hear you were hunting today.”
The boys became cautious as humans always are, faced with a new situation. After a pause Aron
ad-mitted, “Yes, sir.”
“Did you get anything?”
This time a longer pause, and then, “Yes, sir.”
“What did you get?”
“A rabbit.”
“With bows and arrows? Who got him?”
Aron said, “We both shot. We don’t know which one hit.”
Adam said, “Don’t you know your own arrows? We used to mark our arrows when I was a boy.”
This time Aron refused to answer and get into trou-ble. And Cal, after waiting, said, “Well, it was
my arrow, all right, but we think it might have got in Aron’s quiver.”
“What makes you think that?”
“I don’t know,” Cal said. “But I think it was Aron hit the rabbit.”
Adam swung his eyes. “And what do you think?”
“I think maybe I hit it—but I’m not sure.”
“Well, you both seem to handle the situation very well.”
The alarm went out of the faces of the boys. It did not seem to be a trap.
“Where is the rabbit?” Adam asked.
Cal said, “Aron gave it to Abra as a present.”
“She threw it out,” said Aron.
“Why?”
“I don’t know. I wanted to marry her too.”

“You did?”
“Yes, sir.”
“How about you, Cal?”
“I guess I’ll let Aron have her,” said Cal.
Adam laughed, and the boys could not recall ever having heard him laugh. “Is she a nice little
girl?” he asked.
“Oh, yes,” said Aron. “She’s nice, all right. She’s good and nice.”
“Well, I’m glad of that if she’s going to be my daughter-in-law.”
Lee cleared the table and after a quick rattling in the kitchen he came back. “Ready to go to bed?”
he asked the boys.
They glared in protest. Adam said, “Sit down and let them stay a while.”
“I’ve got the accounts together. We can go over them later,” said Lee.
“What accounts, Lee?”
“The house and ranch accounts. You said you wanted to know where you stood.”
“Not the accounts for over ten years, Lee!”
“You never wanted to be bothered before.”
“I guess that’s right. But sit a while. Aron wants to marry the little girl who was here today.”
“Are they engaged?” Lee asked.
“I don’t think she’s accepted him yet,” said Adam. “That may give us some time.”
Cal had quickly lost his awe of the changed feeling in the house and had been examining this
anthill with calculating eyes, trying to determine just how to kick it over. He made his decision.
“She’s a real nice girl,” he said. “I like her. Know why? Well, she said to ask you where our
mother’s grave is, so we can take some flowers.”
“Could we, Father?” Aron asked. “She said she would teach us how to make wreaths.”
Adam’s mind raced. He was not good at lying to begin with, and he hadn’t practiced. The
solution frightened him, it came so quickly to his mind and so glibly to his tongue. Adam said, “I
wish we could do that, boys. But I’ll have to tell you. Your mother’s grave is clear across the
country where she came from.”
“Why?” Aron asked.
“Well, some people want to be buried in the place they came from.”
“How did she get there?” Cal asked. “We put her on a train and sent her home—didn’t we, Lee?”
Lee nodded. “It’s the same with us,” he said. “Near-ly all Chinese get sent home to China after
they die.”
“I know that,” said Aron. “You told us that before.”
“Did I?” Lee asked.
“Sure you did,” said Cal. He was vaguely disap-pointed.
Adam quickly changed the subject. “Mr. Bacon made a suggestion this afternoon,” he began. “I’d
like you boys to think about it. He said it might be better for you if we moved to Salinas—better
schools and lots of other children to play with.”
The thought stunned the twins. Cal asked, “How about here?”

“Well, we’d keep the ranch in case we want to come back.”
Aron said, “Abra lives in Salinas.” And that was enough for Aron. Already he had forgotten the
sailing box. All he could think of was a small apron and a sunbonnet and soft little fingers.
Adam said, “Well, you think about it. Maybe you should go to bed now. Why didn’t you go to
school today?”
“The teacher’s sick,” said Aron.
Lee verified it. “Miss Gulp has been sick for three days,” he said. “They don’t have to go back
until Monday. Come on, boys.”
They followed him obediently from the room.

2
Adam sat smiling vaguely at the lamp and tapping his knee with a forefinger until Lee came back.
Adam said, “Do they know anything?”
“I don’t know,” said Lee.
“Well, maybe it was just the little girl.”
Lee went to the kitchen and brought back a big cardboard box. “Here are the accounts. Every
year has a rubber band around it. I’ve been over it. It’s com-plete.”
“You mean all accounts?”
Lee said, “You’ll find a book for each year and receipted bills for everything. You wanted to
know how you stood. Here it is—all of it. Do you really think you’ll move?”
“Well, I’m thinking of it.”
“I wish there were some way you could tell the boys the truth.”
“That would rob them of the good thoughts about their mother, Lee.”
“Have you thought of the other danger?”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, suppose they find out the truth. Plenty of people know.”
“Well, maybe when they’re older it will be easier for them.”
“I don’t believe that,” said Lee. “But that’s not the worst danger.”
“I guess I don’t follow you, Lee.”
“It’s the lie I’m thinking of. It might infect every-thing. If they ever found out you’d lied to them
about this, the true things would suffer. They wouldn’t believe anything then.”
“Yes, I see. But what can I tell them? I couldn’t tell them the whole truth.”
“Maybe you can tell then a part truth, enough so that you won’t suffer if they find out.”
“I’ll have to think about that, Lee.”
“If you go to live in Salinas it will be more danger-ous.”
“I’ll have to think about it.”
Lee went on insistently, “My father told me about my mother when I was very little, and he
didn’t spare me. He told me a number of times as I was growing. Of course it wasn’t the same,
but it was pretty dreadful. I’m glad he told me though. I wouldn’t like not to know.”
“Do you want to tell me?”

“No, I don’t want to. But it might persuade you to make some change for your own boys. Maybe
if you just said she went away and you don’t know where.”
“But I do know.”
“Yes, there’s the trouble. It’s bound to be all truth or part lie. Well, I can’t force you.”
“I’ll think about it,” said Adam. “What’s the story about your mother?”
“You really want to hear?”
“Only if you want to tell me.”
“I’ll make it very short,” said Lee. “My first memory is of living in a little dark shack alone with
my father in the middle of a potato field, and with it the memory of my father telling me the story
of my mother. His language was Cantonese, but whenever he told the story he spoke in high and
beautiful Mandarin. All right then. I’ll tell you—” And Lee looked back in time.
“I’ll have to tell you first that when you built the railroads in the West the terrible work of
grading and laying ties and spiking the rails was done by many thousands of Chinese. They were
cheap, they worked hard, and if they died no one had to worry. They were recruited largely from
Canton, for the Cantonese are short and strong and durable, and also they are not quarrelsome.
They were brought in by contract, and perhaps the history of my father was a fairly typical one.
“You must know that a Chinese must pay all of his debts on or before our New Year’s day. He
starts every year clean. If he does not, he loses face; but not only that—his family loses face.
There are no excuses.”
“That’s not a bad idea,” said Adam.
“Well, good or bad, that’s the way it was. My father had some bad luck. He could not pay a debt.
The family met and discussed the situation. Ours is an hon-orable family. The bad luck was
nobody’s fault, but the unpaid debt belonged to the whole family. They paid my father’s debt and
then he had to repay them, and that was almost impossible.
“One thing the recruiting agents for the railroad com-panies did—they paid down a lump of
money on the signing of the contract. In this way they caught a great many men who had fallen
into debt. All of this was reasonable and honorable. There was only one black sorrow.
“My father was a young man recently married, and his tie to his wife was very strong and deep
and warm, and hers to him must have been—overwhelming. Nev-ertheless, with good manners
they said good-by in the presence of the heads of the family. I have often thought that perhaps
formal good manners may be a cushion against heartbreak.
“The herds of men went like animals into the black hold of a ship, there to stay until they reached
San Francisco six weeks later. And you can imagine what those holes were like. The merchandise
had to be deliv-ered in some kind of working condition so it was not mistreated. And my people
have learned through the ages to live close together, to keep clean and fed under intolerable
conditions.
“They were a week at sea before my father discov-ered my mother. She was dressed like a man
and she had braided her hair in a man’s queue. By sitting very still and not talking, she had not
been discovered, and of course there were no examinations or vaccinations then. She moved her
mat close to my father. They could not talk except mouth to ear in the dark. My father was angry

at her disobedience, but he was glad too.
“Well, there it was. They were condemned to hard labor for five years. It did not occur to them to
run away once they were in America, for they were honor-able people and they had signed the
contract.”
Lee paused. “I thought I could tell it in a few sentences,” he said. “But you don’t know the background. I’m going to get a cup of water—do you want some?”
“Yes,” said Adam. “But there’s one thing I don’t understand. How could a woman do that kind of
work?”
“I’ll be back in a moment,” said Lee, and he went to the kitchen. He brought back tin cups of
water and put them on the table. He. asked, “Now what did you want to know?”
“How could your mother do a man’s work?”
Lee smiled. “My father said she was a strong wom-an, and I believe a strong woman may be
stronger than a man, particularly if she happens to have love in her heart. I guess a loving woman
is almost indestructible.”
Adam made a wry grimace.
Lee said, “You’ll see one day, you’ll see.”
“I didn’t mean to think badly,” said Adam. “How could I know out of one experience? Go on.”
“One thing my mother did not whisper in my father’s ear during that long miserable crossing.
And because a great many were deadly seasick, no remark was made of her illness.”
Adam cried, “She wasn’t pregnant!”
“She was pregnant,” said Lee. “And she didn’t want to burden my father with more worries.”
“Did she know about it when she started?”
“No, she did not. I set my presence in the world at the most inconvenient time. It’s a longer story
than I thought.”
“Well, you can’t stop now,” said Adam.
“No, I suppose not. In San Francisco the flood of muscle and bone flowed into cattle cars and the
engines puffed up the mountains. They were going to dig hills aside in the Sierras and burrow
tunnels under the peaks. My mother got herded into another car, and my father didn’t see her
until they got to their camp on a high mountain meadow. It was very beautiful, with green grass
and flowers and the snow mountains all around. And only then did she tell my father about me.
“They went to work. A woman’s muscles harden just as a man’s do, and my mother had a
muscular spirit too. She did the pick and shovel work expected of her, and it must have been
dreadful. But a panic worry settled on them about how she was going to have the baby.”
Adam said, “Were they ignorant? Why couldn’t she have gone to the boss and told him she was a
woman and pregnant? Surely they would have taken care of her.”
“You see?” said Lee. “I haven’t told you enough. And that’s why this is so long. They were not
ignorant. These human cattle were imported for one thing only—to work. When the work was
done, those who were not dead were to be shipped back. Only males were brought—no females.
The country did not want them breeding. A man and a woman and a baby have a way of digging
in, of pulling the earth where they are about them and scratching out a home. And then it takes all

hell to root them out. But a crowd of men, nervous, lusting, restless, half sick with loneliness for
women—why, they’ll go anywhere, and particularly will they go home. And my mother was the
only woman in this pack of half-crazy, half-savage men. The longer the men worked and ate, the
more restless they became. To the bosses they were not people but animals which could be
dangerous if not controlled. You can see why my moth-er did not ask for help. Why, they’d have
rushed her out of the camp and—who knows?—perhaps shot and buried her like a diseased cow.
Fifteen men were shot for being a little mutinous.
“No—they kept order the way our poor species has ever learned to keep order. We think there
must be better ways but we never learn them—always the whip, the rope, and the rifle. I wish I
hadn’t started to tell you this—”
“Why should you not tell me?” Adam asked.
“I can see my father’s face when he told me. An old misery comes back, raw and full of pain.
Telling it, my father had to stop and gain possession of himself, and when he continued he spoke
sternly and he used hard sharp words almost as though he wanted to cut himself with them.
“These two managed to stay close together by claim-ing she was my father’s nephew. The
months went by and fortunately for them there was very little abdomi-nal swelling, and she
worked in pain and out of it. My father could only help her a little, apologizing, ‘My nephew is
young and his bones are brittle.’ They had no plan. They did not know what to do.
“And then my father figured out a plan. They would run into the high mountains to one of the
higher mead-ows, and there beside a lake they would make a burrow for the birthing, and when
my mother was safe and the baby born, my father would come back and take his punishment.
And he would sign for an extra five years to pay for his delinquent nephew. Pitiful as their escape
was, it was all they had, and it seemed a brightness. The plan had two requirements—the timing
had to be right and a supply of food was necessary.”
Lee said, “My parents”—and he stopped, smiling over his use of the word, and it felt so good that
he warmed it up—”my dear parents began to make their preparations. They saved a part of their
daily rice and hid it under their sleeping mats. My father found a length of string and filed out a
hook from a piece of wire, for there were trout to be caught in the mountain lakes. He stopped
smoking to save the matches issued. And my mother collected every tattered scrap of cloth she
could find and unraveled edges to make thread and sewed this ragbag together with a splinter to
make swaddling clothes for me. I wish I had known her.”
“So do I,” said Adam. “Did you ever tell this to Sam Hamilton?”
“No Ididn’t. I wish I had. He loved a celebration of the human soul. Such things were like a
personal triumph to him.”
“I hope they got there,” said Adam.
“I know. And when my father would tell me I would say to him, ‘Get to that lake—get my
mother there—don’t let it happen again, not this time. Just once let’s tell it: how you got to the
lake and built a house of fir boughs.’ And my father became very Chinese then. He said, There’s
more beauty in the truth even if it is dreadful beauty. The storytellers at the city gate twist life so
that it looks sweet to the lazy and the stupid and the weak, and this only strengthens their

infirmities and teaches nothing, cures nothing, nor does it let the heart soar.’ ”
“Get on with it,” Adam said irritably.
Lee got up and went to the window, and he finished the story, looking out at the stars that winked
and blew in the March wind.
“A little boulder jumped down a hill and broke my father’s leg. They set the leg and gave him
cripples’ work, straightening used nails with a hammer on a rock. And whether with worry or
work—it doesn’t matter—my mother went into early labor. And then the half-mad men knew and
they went all mad. One hunger sharpened another hunger, and one crime blotted out the one
before it, and the little crimes committed against those starving men flared into one gigantic
maniac crime.
“My father heard the shout ‘Woman’ and he knew. He tried to run and his leg rebroke under him
and he crawled up the ragged slope to the roadbed where it was happening.
“When he got there a kind of sorrow had come over the sky, and the Canton men were creeping
away to hide and to forget that men can be like this. My father came to her on the pile of shale.
She had not even eyes to see out of, but her mouth still moved and she gave him his instructions.
My father clawed me out of the tattered meat of my mother with his fingernails. She died on the
shale in the afternoon.”
Adam was breathing hard. Lee continued in a sing-song cadence, “Before you hate those men
you must know this. My father always told it at the last: No child ever had such care as I. The
whole camp became my mother. It is a beauty—a dreadful kind of beauty. And now good night. I
can’t talk any more.”

3
Adam restlessly opened drawers and looked up at the shelves and raised the lids of boxes in his
house and at last he was forced to call Lee back and ask, “Where’s the ink and the pen?”
“You don’t have any,” said Lee. “You haven’t written a word in years. I’ll lend you mine if you
want.” He went to his room and brought back a squat bottle of ink and a stub pen and a pad of
paper and an envelope and laid them on the table.
Adam asked, “How do you know I want to write a letter?”
“You’re going to try to write to your brother, aren’t you?”
“That’s right.”
“It will be a hard thing to do after so long,” said Lee.
And it was hard. Adam nibbled and munched on the pen and his mouth made strained grimaces.
Sentences were written and the page thrown away and another started. Adam scratched his head
with the penholder. “Lee, if I wanted to take a trip east, would you stay with the twins until I get
back?”
“It’s easier to go than to write,” said Lee. “Sure I’ll stay.”
“No. I’m going to write.”
“Why don’t you ask your brother to come out here?”
“Say, that’s a good idea, Lee. I didn’t think of it.”

“It also gives you a reason for writing, and that’s a good thing.”
The letter came fairly easily then, was corrected and copied fair. Adam read it slowly to himself
before he put it in the envelope.
“Dear brother Charles,” it said. “You will be sur-prised to hear from me after so long. I have
thought of writing many times, but you know how a man puts it off.
“I wonder how this letter finds you. I trust in good health. For all I know you may have five or
even ten children by now. Ha! Ha! I have two sons and they are twins. Their mother is not here.
Country life did not agree with her. She lives in a town nearby and I see her now and then.
“I have got a fine ranch, but I am ashamed to say I do not keep it up very well. Maybe I will do
better from now on. I always did make good resolutions. But for a number of years I felt poorly. I
am well now.
“How are you and how do you prosper? I would like to see you. Why don’t you come to visit
here? It is a great country and you might even find a place where you would like to settle. No
cold winters here. That makes a difference to ‘old men’ like us. Ha! Ha!
“Well, Charles, I hope you will think about it and let me know. The trip would do you good. I
want to see you. I have much to tell you that I can’t write down.
“Well, Charles, write me a letter and tell me all the news of the old home. I suppose many things
have happened. As you get older you hear mostly about people you knew that died. I guess that is
the way of the world. Write quick and tell me if you will come to visit. Your brother Adam.”
He sat holding the letter in his hand and looking over it at his brother’s dark face and its scarred
fore-head. Adam could see the glinting heat in the brown eyes, and as he looked he saw the lips
writhe back from the teeth and the blind destructive animal take charge. He shook his head to rid
his memory of the vision, and he tried to rebuild the face smiling. He tried to remem-ber the
forehead before the scar, but he could not bring either into focus. He seized the pen and wrote
below his signature, “P.S. Charles, I never hated you no matter what. I always loved you because
you were my brother.”
Adam folded the letter and forced the creases sharp with his fingernails. He sealed the envelope
flap with his fist. “Lee!” he called, “Oh, Lee!”
The Chinese looked in through the door.
“Lee, how long does it take a letter to go east—clear east?”
“I don’t know,” said Lee. “Two weeks maybe.”

Chapter 29
1
After his first letter to his brother in over ten years was mailed Adam became impatient for an
answer. He forgot how much time had elapsed. Before the letter got as far as San Francisco he
was asking aloud in Lee’s hearing, “I wonder why he doesn’t answer. Maybe he’s mad at me for
not writing. But he didn’t write either. No—he didn’t know where to write. Maybe he’s moved
away.”
Lee answered, “It’s only been gone a few days. Give it time.”
“I wonder whether he would really come out here?” Adam asked himself, and he wondered
whether he wanted Charles. Now that the letter was gone, Adam was afraid Charles might accept.
He was like a restless child whose fingers stray to every loose article. He interfered with the
twins, asked them innumerable questions about school.
“Well, what did you learn today?”
“Nothing!”
“Oh, come! You must have learned something. Did you read?”
“Yes, sir.”
“What did you read?”
“That old one about the grasshopper and the ant.”
“Well, that’s interesting.”
“There’s one about an eagle carries a baby away.”
“Yes, I remember that one. I forget what happens.”
“We aren’t to it yet. We saw the pictures.”
The boys were disgusted. During one of Adam’s moments of fatherly bungling Cal borrowed his
pocketknife, hoping he would forget to ask for it back. But the sap was beginning to run freely in
the willows. The bark would slip easily from a twig. Adam got his knife back to teach the boys to
make willow whistles, a thing Lee had taught them three years before. To make it worse, Adam
had forgotten how to make the cut. He couldn’t get a peep out of his whistles.
At noon one day Will Hamilton came roaring and bumping up the road in a new Ford. The engine
raced in its low gear, and the high top swayed like a storm-driven ship. The brass radiator and the
Prestolite tank on the running board were blinding with brass polish.
Will pulled up the brake lever, turned the switch straight down, and sat back in the leather seat.
The car backfired several times without ignition because it was overheated.
“Here she is!” Will called with a false enthusiasm. He hated Fords with a deadly hatred, but they
were daily building his fortune.
Adam and Lee hung over the exposed insides of the car while Will Hamilton, puffing under the

burden of his new fat, explained the workings of a mechanism he did not understand himself.
It is hard now to imagine the difficulty of learning to start, drive, and maintain an automobile.
Not only was the whole process complicated, but one had to start from scratch. Today’s children
breathe in the theory, habits, and idiosyncrasies of the internal combustion engine in their cradles,
but then you started with the blank belief that it would not run at all, and sometimes you were
right. Also, to start the engine of a modern car you do just two things, turn a key and touch the
starter. Everything else is automatic. The process used to be more complicated. It required not
only a good memory, a strong arm, an angelic temper, and a blind hope, but also a certain amount
of practice of magic, so that a man about to turn the crank of a Model T might be seen to spit on
the ground and whisper a spell.
Will Hamilton explained the car and went back and explained it again. His customers were wideeyed, inter-ested as terriers, cooperative, and did not interrupt, but as he began for the third time
Will saw that he was getting no place.
“Tell you what!” he said brightly. “You see, this isn’t my line. I wanted you to see her. and listen
to her before I made delivery. Now, I’ll go back to town and tomorrow I’ll send out this car with
an expert, and he’ll tell you more in a few minutes than I could in a week. But I just wanted you
to see her.”
Will had forgotten some of his own instructions. He cranked for a while and then borrowed a
buggy and a horse from Adam and drove to town, but he promised to have a mechanic out the
next day.

2
There was no question of sending the twins to school the next day. They wouldn’t have gone. The
Ford stood tall and aloof and dour under the oak tree where Will had stopped it. Its new owners
circled it and touched it now and then, the way you touch a dangerous horse to soothe him.
Lee said, “I wonder whether I’ll ever get used to it.”
“Of course you will,” Adam said without conviction. “Why, you’ll be driving all over the county
first thing you know.”
“I will try to understand it,” Lee said. “But drive it I will not.”
The boys made little dives in and out, to touch something and leap away. “What’s this do-hickey,
Fa-ther?”
“Get your hands off that.”
“But what’s it for?”
“I don’t know, but don’t touch it. You don’t know what might happen.”
“Didn’t the man tell you?”
“I don’t remember what he said. Now you boys get away from it or I’ll have to send you to
school. Do you hear me, Cal? Don’t open that.”
They had got up and were ready very early in the morning. By eleven o’clock hysterical
nervousness had set in. The mechanic drove up in the buggy in time for the midday meal. He
wore box-toed shoes and Duchess trousers and his wide square coat came almost to his knees.

Beside him in the buggy was a satchel in which were his working clothes and tools. He was
nineteen and chewed tobacco, and from his three months in automobile school he had gained a
great though weary contempt for human beings. He spat and threw the lines at Lee.
“Put this hayburner away,” he said, “How do you tell which end is the front?” And he climbed
down from the rig as an ambassador comes out of a state train. He sneered at the twins and turned
coldly to Adam, “I hope I’m in time for dinner,” he said.
Lee and Adam stared at each other. They had for-gotten about the noonday meal.
In the house the godling grudgingly accepted cheese and bread and cold meat and pie and coffee
and a piece of chocolate cake.
“I’m used to a hot dinner,” he said. “You better keep those kids away if you want any car left.”
After a leisurely meal and a short rest on the porch the mechanic took his satchel into Adam’s
bedroom. In a few minutes he emerged, dressed in striped overalls and a white cap which had
“Ford” printed on the front of its crown.
“Well,” he said. “Done any studying?”
“Studying?” Adam said.
“Ain’t you even read the litature in the book under the seat?”
“I didn’t know it was there,” said Adam.
“Oh, Lord,” said the young man disgustedly. With a courageous gathering of his moral forces he
moved with decision toward the car. “Might as well get started,” he said. “God knows how long
it’s going to take if you ain’t studied.”
Adam said, “Mr. Hamilton couldn’t start it last night.”
“He always tries to start it on the magneto,” said the sage. “All right! All right, come along.
Know the prin-ciples of a internal combustion engine?”
“No,” said Adam.
“Oh, Jesus Christ!” He lifted the tin flaps. “This-here is a internal combustion engine,” he said.
Lee said quietly, “So young to be so erudite.”
The boy swung around toward him, scowling. “What did you say?” he demanded, and he asked
Adam, “What did the Chink say?”
Lee spread his hands and smiled blandly. “Say velly smaht fella,” he observed quietly. “Mebbe
go college. Velly wise.”
“Just call me Joe!” the boy said for no reason at all, and he added, “College! What do them fellas
know? Can they set a timer, huh? Can they file a point? College!” And he spat a brown
disparaging comment on the ground. The twins regarded him with admiration, and Cal collected
spit on the back of his tongue to practice.
Adam said, “Lee was admiring your grasp of the subject.”
The truculence went out of the boy and a magna-nimity took its place. “Just call me Joe,” he said.
“I ought to know it. Went to automobile school in Chicago. That’s a real school—not like no
college.” And he said, “My old man says you take a good Chink, I mean a good one—why, he’s
about as good as anybody. They’re honest.”
“But not the bad ones,” said Lee.

“Hell no! Not no highbinders nor nothing like that. But good Chinks.”
“I hope I may be included in that group?”
“You look like a good Chink to me. Just call me Joe.”
Adam was puzzled at the conversation, but the twins weren’t. Cal said experimentally to Aron,
“Jus’ call me Joe,” and Aron moved his lips, trying out, “Jus’ call me Joe.”
The mechanic became professional again but his tone was kinder. An amused friendliness took
the place of his former contempt. “This-here,” he said, “is a inter-nal combustion engine.” They
looked down at the ugly lump of iron with a certain awe.
Now the boy went on so rapidly that the words ran together into a great song of the new era.
“Operates through the explosion of gases in a enclosed space. Power of explosion is exerted on
piston and through connecting rod and crankshaft through transmission thence to rear wheels. Got
that?” They nodded blankly, afraid to stop the flow. “They’s two kinds, two cycle and four cycle.
This-here is four cycle. Got that?”
Again they nodded. The twins, looking up into his face with adoration, nodded.
“That’s interesting,” said Adam.
Joe went on hurriedly, “Main difference of a Ford automobile from other kinds is its planetary
transmis-sion which operates on a rev-rev-a-lu-shun-ary princi-ple.” He pulled up for a moment,
his face showing strain. And when his four listeners nodded again he cautioned them, “Don’t get
the idea you know it all. The planetary system is, don’t forget, rev-a-lu-shun-ary. You better
study up on it in the book. Now, if you got all that we’ll go on to Operation of the Automo-bile.”
He said this in boldface type, capital letters. He was obviously glad to be done with the first part
of his lecture, but he was no gladder than his listeners. The strain of concentration was beginning
to tell on them, and it was not made any better by the fact that they had not understood one single
word.
“Come around here,” said the boy. “Now you see that-there? That’s the ignition key. When you
turn that-there you’re ready to go ahead. Now, you push this do-hickey to the left. That puts her
on battery—see, where it says Bat. That means battery.” They craned their necks into the car. The
twins were standing on the running board.
“No—wait. I got ahead of myself. First you got to retard the spark and advance the gas, else
she’ll kick your goddam arm off. This-here—see it?—this-here’s the spark. You push it up—get
it?—up. Clear up. And this-here’s the gas—you push her down. Now I’m going to explain it and
then I’m going to do it. I want you to pay attention. You kids get off the car. You’re in my light.
Get down, goddam it.” The boys reluctantly climbed down from the running board; only their
eyes looked over the door.
He took a deep breath. “Now you ready? Spark retarded, gas advanced. Spark up, gas down. Now
switch to battery—left, remember—left.” A buzzing like that of a gigantic bee sounded. “Hear
that? That’s the contact in one of the coil boxes. If you don’t get that, you got to adjust the points
or maybe file them.” He noticed a look of consternation on Adam’s face. “You can study up on
that in the book,” he said kindly.
He moved to the front of the car. “Now this-here is the crank and—see this little wire sticking out

of the radiator?—that’s the choke. Now watch careful while I show you. You grab the crank like
this and push till she catches. See how my thumb is turned down? If I grabbed her the other way
with my thumb around her, and she was to kick, why, she’d knock my thumb off. Got it?”
He didn’t look up but he knew they were nodding.
“Now,” he said, “look careful. I push in and bring her up until I got compression, and then, why, I
pull out this wire and I bring her around careful to suck gas in. Hear that sucking sound? That’s
choke. But don’t pull her too much or you’ll flood her. Now, I let go the wire and I give her a hell
of spin, and as soon as she catches I run around and advance the spark and retard the gas and I
reach over and throw the switch quick over to magneto—see where it says Mag?—and there you
are.”
His listeners were limp. After all this they had just got the engine started.
The boy kept at them. “I want you to say after me now so you learn it. Spark up—gas down.”
They repeated in chorus, “Spark up—gas down.”
“Switch to Bat.”
“Switch to Bat.”
“Crank to compression, thumb down.”
“Crank to compression, thumb down.”
“Easy over—choke out.”
“Easy over—choke out.”
“Spin her.”
“Spin her.”
“Spark down—gas up.”
“Spark down—gas up.”
“Switch to Mag.”
“Switch to Mag.”
“Now, we’ll go over her again. Just call me Joe.”
“Just call you Joe.”
“Not that. Spark up—gas down.”
A kind of weariness settled on Adam as they went over the litany for the fourth time. The process
seemed silly to him. He was relieved when a short time later Will Hamilton drove up in his low
sporty red car. The boy looked at the approaching vehicle. “That-there’s got sixteen valves,” he
said in a reverent tone. “Special job.”
Will leaned out of his car. “How’s it going?” he asked.
“Just fine,” said the mechanic. “They catch on quick.”
“Look, Roy, I’ve got to take you in. The new hearse knocked out a bearing. You’ll have to work
late to get it ready for Mrs. Hawks at eleven tomorrow.”
Roy snapped to efficient attention. “I’ll get my clos’,” he said and ran for the house. As he tore
back with his satchel Cal stood in his way.
“Hey,” Cal said, “I thought your name was Joe.”
“How do you mean, Joe?”

“You told us to call you Joe. Mr. Hamilton says you’re Roy.”
Roy laughed and jumped into the roadster. “Know why I say call me Joe?”
“No. Why?”
“Because my name is Roy.” In the midst of his laughter he stopped and said sternly to Adam,
“You get that book under the seat and you study up. Hear me?”
“I will,” said Adam.

Chapter 30
1
Even as in Biblical times, there were miracles on the earth in those days. One week after the
lesson a Ford bumped up the main street of King City and pulled to a shuddering stop in front of
the post office. Adam sat at the wheel with Lee beside him and the two boys straight and grand in
the back seat.
Adam looked down at the floorboards, and all four chanted in unison, “Brake on—advance gas—
switch off.” The little engine roared and then stopped. Adam sat back for a moment, limp but
proud, before he got out.
The postmaster looked out between the bars of his golden grill. “I see you’ve got one of the damn
things,” he said.
“Have to keep up with the times,” said Adam.
“I predict there’ll come a time when you can’t find a horse, Mr. Trask.”
“Maybe so.”
“They’ll change the face of the countryside. They get their clatter into everything,” the
postmaster went on. “We even feel it here. Man used to come for his mail once a week. Now he
comes every day, sometimes twice a day. He just can’t wait for his damn catalogue. Running
around. Always running around.” He was so violent in his dislike that Adam knew he hadn’t
bought a Ford yet. It was a kind of jealousy coming out. “I wouldn’t have one around,” the
postmaster said, and this meant that his wife was at him to buy one. It was the women who put
the pressure on. Social status was involved.
The postmaster angrily shuffled through the letters from the T box and tossed out a long
envelope. “Well, I’ll see you in the hospital,” he said viciously.
Adam smiled at him and took his letter and walked out.
A man who gets few letters does not open one light-ly. He hefts it for weight, reads the name of
the sender on the envelope and the address, looks at the handwrit-ing, and studies the postmark
and the date. Adam was out of the post office and across the sidewalk to his Ford before he had
done all of these things. The left-hand corner of the envelope had printed on it, Bellows and
Harvey, Attorneys at Law, and their address was the town in Connecticut from which Adam had
come.
He said in a pleasant tone, “Why, I know Bellows and Harvey, know them well. I wonder what
they want?” He looked closely at the envelope. “I wonder how they got my address?” He turned
the envelope over and looked at the back. Lee watched him, smiling. “Maybe the questions are
answered in the letter.”
“I guess so,” Adam said. Once having decided to open the letter, he took out his pocketknife,

opened the big blade, and inspected the envelope for a point of ingress, found none, held the letter
up to the sun to make sure not to cut the message, tapped the letter to one end of the envelope,
and cut off the other end. He blew in the end and extracted the letter with two fingers. He read the
letter very slowly.
“Mr. Adam Trask, King City, California, Dear Sir,” it began testily, “For the last six months we
have exhausted every means of locating you. We have adver-tised in newspapers all over the
country without suc-cess. It was only when your letter to your brother was turned over to us by
the local postmaster that we were able to ascertain your whereabouts.” Adam could feel their
impatience with him. The next paragraph began a complete change of mood. “It is our sad duty to
inform you that your brother Charles Trask is deceased. He died of a lung ailment October 12
after an illness of two weeks, and his body rests in the Odd Fellows cemetery. No stone marks his
grave. We presume you will want to undertake this sorrowful duty yourself.”
Adam drew a deep full breath and held it while he read the paragraph again. He breathed out
slowly to keep the release from being a sigh. “My brother Charles is dead,” he said.
“I’m sorry,” said Lee.
Cal said, “Is he our uncle?”
“He was your Uncle Charles,” said Adam.
“Mine too?” Aron asked.
“Yours too.”
“I didn’t know we had him,” Aron said. “Maybe we can put some flowers on his grave. Abra
would help us. She likes to.”
“It’s a long way off—clear across the country.”
Aron said excitedly, “I know! When we take flowers to our mother we’ll take some to our Uncle
Charles.” And he said a little sadly, “I wish’t I knew I had him be-fore he was dead.” He felt that
he was growing rich in dead relatives. “Was he nice?” Aron asked.
“Very nice,” said Adam. “He was my only brother, just like Cal is your only brother.”
“Were you twins too?”
“No—not twins.”
Cal asked, “Was he rich?”
“Of course not,” said Adam. “Where’d you get that idea?”
“Well, if he was rich we’d get it, wouldn’t we?”
Adam said sternly, “At a time of death it isn’t a nice thing to talk about money. We’re sad
because he died.”
“How can I be sad?” said Cal. “I never even saw him.”
Lee covered his mouth with his hand to conceal his smile. Adam looked back at the letter, and
again it changed mood with its paragraph.
“As attorneys for the deceased it is our pleasant duty to inform you that your brother through
industry and judgment amassed a considerable fortune, which in land, securities, and cash is well
in excess of one hun-dred thousand dollars. His will, which was drawn and signed in this office,
is in our hands and will be sent to you on your request. By its terms it leaves all money, property,

and securities to be divided equally between you and your wife. In the event that your wife is
deceased, the total goes to you. The will also stipulates that if you are deceased, all property goes
to your wife. We judge from your letter that you are still in the land of the living and we wish to
offer our congratulations. Your obedient servants, Bellows and Harvey, by George B. Harvey.”
And at the bottom of the page was scrawled, “Dear Adam: Forget not thy servants in the days of
thy prosperity. Charles never spent a dime. He pinched a dollar until the eagle screamed. I hope
you and your wife will get some pleasure from the money. Is there an opening out there for a
good lawyer? I mean myself. Your old friend, Geo. Harvey.”
Adam looked over the edge of the letter at the boys and at Lee. All three were waiting for him to
continue. Adam’s mouth shut to a line. He folded the letter, put it in its envelope, and placed the
envelope carefully in his inside pocket.
“Any complications?” Lee asked.
“No.”
“I just thought you looked concerned.”
“I’m not. I’m sad about my brother.” Adam was trying to arrange the letter’s information in his
mind, and it was as restless as a setting hen scrounging into the nest. He felt that he would have
to be alone to absorb it. He climbed into the car and looked blankly at the mechanism. He
couldn’t remember a single procedure.
Lee asked, “Want some help?”
“Funny!” said Adam. “I can’t remember where to start.”
Lee and the boys began softly, “Spark up—gas down, switch over to Bat.”
“Oh, yes. Of course, of course.” And while the loud bee hummed in the coil box Adam cranked
the Ford and ran to advance the spark and throw the switch to Mag.
They were driving slowly up the lumpy road of the home draw under the oak trees when Lee
said, “We forgot to get meat.”
“Did we? I guess we did. Well, can’t we have some-thing else?”
“How about bacon and eggs?”
“That’s fine. That’s good.”
“You’ll want to mail your answer tomorrow,” said Lee. “You can buy meat then.”
“I guess so,” said Adam.
While dinner was preparing Adam sat staring into space. He knew he would have to have help
from Lee, if only the help of a listener to clear his own thinking.
Cal had led his brother outside and conducted him to the wagon shed where the tall Ford rested.
Cal opened the door and sat behind the wheel. “Come on, get in!” he said.
Aron protested, “Father told us to stay out of it.”
“He won’t ever know. Get in!”
Aron climbed in timidly and eased back in the seat. Cal turned the wheel from side to side.
“Honk, honk,” he said, and then, “Know what I think? I think Uncle Charles was rich.”
“He was not.”
“I bet you anything he was.”

“You think our father’d tell a lie.”
“I won’t say that. I just bet he was rich.” They were silent for a while. Cal steered wildly around
imaginary curves. He said, “I bet you I can find out.”
“How do you mean?”
“What you got to bet?”
“Nothing,” said Aron.
“How about your deer’s-leg whistle? I bet you this-here taw against that deer’s-leg whistle that
we get sent to bed right after supper. Is it a bet?”
“I guess so,” Aron said vaguely. “I don’t see why.”
Cal said, “Father will want to talk to Lee. And I’m going to listen.”
“You won’t dare.”
“You think I won’t.”
“ ’Spose I was to tell.”
Cal’s eyes turned cold and his face darkened. He leaned so close that his voice dropped to a
whisper. “You won’t tell. Because if you do—I’ll tell who stole his knife.”
“Nobody stole his knife. He’s got his knife. He opened the letter with it.”
Cal smiled bleakly. “I mean tomorrow,” he said. And Aron saw what he meant and he knew he
couldn’t tell. He couldn’t do anything about it. Cal was perfectly safe.
Cal saw the confusion and helplessness on Aron’s face and felt his power, and it made him glad.
He could outthink and outplan his brother. He was beginning to think he could do the same thing
to his father. With Lee, Cal’s tricks did not work, for Lee’s bland mind moved effortlessly ahead
of him and was always there waiting, understanding, and at the last moment caution-ing quietly,
“Don’t do it.” Cal had respect for Lee and a little fear of him. But Aron here, looking helplessly
at him, was a lump of soft mud in his hands. Cal sudden-ly felt a deep love for his brother and an
impulse to protect him in his weakness. He put his arm around Aron.
Aron did not flinch or respond. He drew back a little to see Cal’s face.
Cal said, “See any green grass growing out of my head?”
Aron said, “I don’t know why you go for to do it.”
“How do you mean? Do what?”
“All the tricky, sneaky things,” said Aron.
“What do you mean, sneaky?”
“Well, about the rabbit, and sneaking here in the car. And you did something to Abra. I don’t
know what, but it was you made her throw the box away.”
“Ho,” said Cal. “Wouldn’t you like to know!” But he was uneasy.
Aron said slowly. “I wouldn’t want to know that. I’d like to know why you do it. You’re always
at some-thing. I just wonder why you do it. I wonder what’s it good for.”
A pain pierced Cal’s heart. His planning suddenly seemed mean and dirty to him. He knew that
his brother had found him out. And he felt a longing for Aron to love him. He felt lost and hungry
and he didn’t know what to do.
Aron opened the door of the Ford and climbed down and walked out of the wagon shed. For a

few moments Cal twisted the steering wheel and tried to imagine he was racing down the road.
But it wasn’t any good, and soon he followed Aron back toward the house.

2
When supper was finished and Lee had washed the dishes Adam said, “I think you boys had
better go to bed. It’s been a big day.”
Aron looked quickly at Cal and slowly took his deer’s-leg whistle out of his pocket.
Cal said, “I don’t want it.”
Aron said, “It’s yours now.”
“Well, I don’t want it. I won’t have it.”
Aron laid the bone whistle on the table. “It’ll be here for you,” he said.
Adam broke in, “Say, what is this argument? I said you boys should go to bed.”
Cal put on his “little boy” face. “Why?” he asked. “It’s too early to go to bed.”
Adam said, “That wasn’t quite the truth I told you. I want to talk privately to Lee. And it’s getting
dark so you can’t go outside, so I want you boys to go to bed—at least to your room. Do you
understand?”
Both boys said, “Yes, sir,” and they followed Lee down the hall to their bedroom at the back of
the house. In their nightgowns they returned to say good night to their father.
Lee came back to the living room and closed the door to the hall. He picked up the deer’s-leg
whistle and inspected it and laid it down. “I wonder what went on there,” he said.
“How do you mean, Lee?”
“Well, some bet was made before supper, and just after supper Aron lost the bet and paid off.
What were we talking about?”
“All I can remember is telling them to go to bed.”
“Well, maybe it will come out later,” said Lee.
“Seems to me you put too much stock in the affairs of children. It probably didn’t mean
anything.”
“Yes, it meant something.” Then he said, “Mr. Trask, do you think the thoughts of people
suddenly become important at a given age? Do you have sharper feelings or clearer thoughts now
than when you were ten? Do you see as well, hear as well, taste as vitally?”
“Maybe you’re right,” said Adam.
“It’s one of the great fallacies, it seems to me,” said Lee, “that time gives much of anything but
years and sadness to a man.”
“And memory.”
“Yes, memory. Without that, time would be unarmed against us. What did you want to talk to me
about?”
Adam took the letter from his pocket and put it on the table. “I want you to read this, to read it
carefully, and then—I want to talk about it.” Lee took out his half-glasses and put them on. He
opened the letter under the lamp and read it.
Adam asked, “Well?”

“Is there an opening here for a lawyer?”
“How do you mean? Oh, I see. Are you making a joke?”
“No, said Lee, “I was not making a joke. In my obscure but courteous Oriental manner I was
indicating to you that I would prefer to know your opinion before I offered mine.”
“Are you speaking sharply to me?”
“Yes, I am,” said Lee. “I’ll lay aside my Oriental manner. I’m getting old and cantankerous. I am
growing impatient. Haven’t you heard of all Chinese servants that when they get old they remain
loyal but they turn mean?”
“I don’t want to hurt your feelings.”
“They aren’t hurt. You want to talk about this letter. Then talk, and I will know from your talk
whether I can offer an honest opinion or whether it is better to reassure you in your own.”
“I don’t understand it,” said Adam helplessly.
“Well, you knew your brother. If you don’t under-stand it, how can I, who never saw him?”
Adam got up and opened the hall door and did not see the shadow that slipped behind it. He went
to his room and returned and put a faded brown daguerreo-type on the table in front of Lee. “That
is my brother Charles,” he said, and he went back to the hall door and closed it.
Lee studied the shiny metal under the lamp, shifting the picture this way and that to overcome the
highlights. “It’s a long time ago,” Adam said. “Before I went into the army.”
Lee leaned close to the picture. “It’s hard to make out. But from his expression I wouldn’t say
your broth-er had much humor.”
“He hadn’t any,” said Adam. “He never laughed.”
“Well, that wasn’t exactly what I meant. When I read the terms of your brother’s will it struck me
that he might have been a man with a particularly brutal sense of play. Did he like you?”
“I don’t know,” said Adam. “Sometimes I thought he loved me. He tried to kill me once.”
Lee said, “Yes, that’s in his face—both the love and the murder. And the two made a miser of
him, and a miser is a frightened man hiding in a fortress of money. Did he know your wife?”
“Yes.”
“Did he love her?”
“He hated her.”
Lee sighed. “It doesn’t really matter. That’s not your problem, is it?”
“No. It isn’t.”
“Would you like to bring the problem out and look at it?”
“That’s what I want.”
“Go ahead then.”
“I can’t seem to get my mind to work clearly.”
“Would you like me to lay out the cards for you? The uninvolved can sometimes do that.”
“That’s what I want.”
“Very well then.” Suddenly Lee grunted and a look of astonishment came over his face. He held
his round chin in his thin small hand. “Holy horns!” he said. “I didn’t think of that.”
Adam stirred uneasily. “I wish you’d get off the tack you’re sitting on,” he said irritably. “You

make me feel like a column of figures on a blackboard.”
Lee took a pipe from his pocket, a long slender ebony stem with a little cuplike brass bowl. He
filled the thimble bowl with tobacco so fine-cut it looked like hair, then lighted the pipe, took
four long puffs, and let the pipe go out.
“Is that opium?” Adam demanded.
“No,” said Lee. “It’s a cheap brand of Chinese tobacco, and it has an unpleasant taste.”
“Why do you smoke it then?”
“I don’t know,” said Lee. “I guess it reminds me of something—something I associate with
clarity. Not very complicated.” Lee’s eyelids half closed. “All right then—I’m going to try to pull
out your thoughts like egg noodles and let them dry in the sun. The woman is still your wife and
she is still alive. Under the letter of the will she inherits something over fifty thousand dol-lars.
That is a great deal of money. A sizable chunk of good or of evil could be done with it. Would
your brother, if he knew where she is and what she is doing, want her to have the money? Courts
always try to follow the wishes of the testator.”
“My brother would not want that,” said Adam. And then he remembered the girls upstairs in the
tavern and Charles’ periodic visits.
“Maybe you’ll have to think for your brother,” said Lee. “What your wife is doing is neither good
nor bad. Saints can spring from any soil. Maybe with this money she would do some “fine thing.
There’s no springboard to philanthropy like a bad conscience.”
Adam shivered. “She told me what she would do if she had money. It was closer to murder than
to charity.”
“You don’t think she should have the money then?”
“She said she would destroy many reputable men in Salinas. She can do it too.”
“I see,” said Lee. “I’m glad I can take a detached view of this. The pants of their reputations must
have some thin places. Morally, then, you would be against giving her the money?”
“Yes.”
“Well, consider this. She has no name, no back-ground. A whore springs full blown from the
earth. She couldn’t very well claim the money, if she knew about it, without your help.”
“I guess that’s so. Yes, I can see that she might not be able to claim it without my help.”
Lee took up the pipe and picked out the ash with a little brass pin and filled the bowl again. While
he drew in the four slow puffs his heavy lids raised and he watched Adam.
“It’s a very delicate moral problem,” he said. “With your permission I shall offer it for the
consideration of my honorable relatives—using no names of course. They will go over it as a boy
goes over a dog for ticks. I’m sure they will get some interesting results.” He laid his pipe on the
table. “But you don’t have any choice, do you?”
“What do you mean by that?” Adam demanded. “Well, do you? Do you know yourself so much
less than I do?”
“I don’t know what to do,” said Adam. “I’ll have to give it a lot of thought.”
Lee said angrily, “I guess I’ve been wasting my time. Are you lying to yourself or only to me?”
“Don’t speak to me like that!” Adam said.

“Why not? I have always disliked deception. Your course is drawn. What you will do is written—
written in every breath you’ve ever taken. I’ll speak any way I want to. I’m crotchety. I feel sand
under my skin. I’m. looking forward to the ugly smell of old books and the sweet smell of good
thinking. Faced with two sets of morals, you’ll follow your training. What you call think-ing
won’t change it. The fact that your wife is a whore in Salinas won’t change a thing.”
Adam got to his feet. His face was angry. “You are insolent now that you’ve decided to go
away,” he cried. “I tell you I haven’t made up my mind what to do about the money.”
Lee sighed deeply. He pushed his small body erect with his hands against his knees. He walked
wearily to the front door and opened it. He turned back and smiled at Adam. “Bull shit!” he said
amiably, and he went out and closed the door behind him.

Cal crept quietly down the dark hall and edged into the room where he and his brother slept. He
saw the out-line of his brother’s head against the pillow in the double bed, but he could not see
whether Aron slept. Very gently he eased himself in on his side and turned slowly and laced his
fingers behind his head and stared at the myriads of tiny colored dots that make up dark-ness. The
window shade bellied slowly in and then the night wind fell and the worn shade flapped quietly
against the window.
A gray, quilted melancholy descended on him. He wished with all his heart that Aron had not
walked away from him out of the wagon shed. He wished with all his heart that he had not
crouched listening at the hall door. He moved his lips in the darkness and made the words silently
in his head and yet he could hear them.
“Dear Lord,” he said, “let me be like Aron. Don’t make me mean. I don’t want to be. If you will
let everybody like me, why, I’ll give you anything in the world, and if I haven’t got it, why, I’ll
go for to get it. I don’t want to be mean. I don’t want to be lonely. For Jesus’ sake, Amen.” Slow
warm tears were running down his cheeks. His muscles were tight and he fought against making
any crying sound or sniffle.
Aron whispered from his pillow in the dark, “You’re cold. You’ve got a chill.” He stretched out
his hand to Cal’s arm and felt the goose bumps there. He asked softly, “Did Uncle Charles have
any money?”
“No,” said Cal.
“Well, you were out there long enough. What did Father want to talk about?”
Cal lay still, trying to control his breathing.
“Don’t you want to tell me?” Aron asked. “I don’t care if you don’t tell me.”
“I’ll tell,” Cal whispered. He turned on his side so that his back was toward his brother. “Father is
going to send a wreath to our mother. A great big goddam wreath of carnations.”
Aron half sat up in bed and asked excitedly, “He is? How’s he going to get it clear there?”
“On the train. Don’t talk so loud.”
Aron dropped back to a whisper. “But how’s it going to keep fresh?”
“With ice,” said Cal. “They’re going to pack ice all around it.”

Aron asked, “Won’t it take a lot of ice?”
“A whole hell of a lot of ice,” said Cal. “Go to sleep now.”
Aron was silent, and then he said, “I hope it gets there fresh and nice.”
“It will,” said Cal. And in his mind he cried, “Don’t let me be mean.”

Chapter 31

Adam brooded around the house all morning, and at noon he went to find Lee, who was spading
the dark composted earth of his vegetable garden and planting his spring vegetables, carrots and
beets, turnips, peas, and string beans, rutabaga and kale. The rows were straight planted under a
tight-stretched string, and the pegs at the row ends carried the seed package to identi-fy the row.
On the edge of the garden in a cold frame the tomato and bell pepper and cabbage sets were
nearly ready for transplanting, waiting only for the passing of the frost danger.
Adam said, “I guess I was stupid.”
Lee leaned on his spading fork and regarded him quietly.
“When are you going?” he asked.
“I thought I would catch the two-forty. Then I can get the eight o’clock back.”
“You could put it in a letter, you know,” said Lee.
“I’ve thought of that. Would you write a letter?”
“No. You’re right. I’m the stupid one there. No letters.”
“I have to go,” said Adam. “I thought in all direc-tions and always a leash snapped me back.”
Lee said, “You can be unhonest in many ways, but not in that way. Well, good luck. I’ll be
interested to hear what she says and does.”
“I’ll take the rig,” said Adam. “I’ll leave it at the stable in King City. I’m nervous about driving
the Ford alone.”
It was four-fifteen when Adam climbed the rickety steps and knocked on the weather-beaten door
of Kate’s place. A new man opened the door, a square-faced Finn, dressed in shirt and trousers;
red silk armbands held up his full sleeves. He left Adam standing on the porch and in a moment
came back and led him to the dining room.
It was a large undecorated room, the walls and woodwork painted white. A long square table
filled the center of the room, and on the white oilcloth cover the places were set—plates, cups
and saucers, and the cups upside down in the saucers.
Kate sat at the head of the table with an account book open before her. Her dress was severe. She
wore a green eyeshade, and she rolled a yellow pencil restlessly in her fingers. She looked coldly
at Adam as he stood in the doorway.
“What do you want now?” she asked.
The Finn stood behind Adam.
Adam did not reply. He walked to the table and laid the letter in front of her on top of the account
book.
“What’s this?” she asked, and without waiting for a reply she read the letter quickly. “Go out and

close the door,” she told the Finn.
Adam sat at the table beside her. He pushed the dishes aside to make a place for his hat.
When the door was closed Kate said, “Is this a joke? No, you haven’t got a joke in you.” She
considered. “Your brother might be joking. You sure he’s dead?”
“All I have is the letter,” said Adam.
“What do you want me to do about it?”
Adam shrugged his shoulders.
Kate said, “If you want me to sign anything, you’re wasting your time. What do you want?”
Adam drew his finger slowly around his black ribbon hatband. “Why don’t you write down the
name of the firm and get in touch with them yourself?”
“What have you told them about me?”
“Nothing,” said Adam. “I wrote to Charles and said you were living in another town, nothing
more. He was dead when the letter got there. The letter went to the lawyers. It tells about it.”
“The one who wrote the postscript seems to be a friend of yours. What have you written him?”
“I haven’t answered the letter yet.”
“What do you intend to say when you answer it?”
“The same thing—that you live in another town.”
“You can’t say we’ve been divorced. We haven’t been.”
“I don’t intend to.”
“Do you want to know how much it will take to buy me off? I’ll take forty-five thousand in cash.”
“No.”
“What do you mean—no? You can’t bargain.”
“I’m not bargaining. You have the letter, you know as much as I do. Do what you want.”
“What makes you so cocky?”
“I feel safe.”
She peered at him from under the green transparent eyeshade. Little curls of her hair lay on the
bill like vines on a green roof. “Adam, you’re a fool. If you had kept your mouth shut nobody
would ever have known I was alive.”
“I know that.”
“You know it? Did you think I might be afraid to claim the money? You’re a damn fool if you
thought that.”
Adam said patiently, “I don’t care what you do.”
She smiled cynically at him. “You don’t, huh? Sup-pose I should tell you that there’s a
permanent order in the sheriffs office, left there by the old sheriff, that if I ever use your name or
admit I’m your wife I’ll get a floater out of the county and out of the state. Does that tempt you?”
“Tempt me to do what?”
“To get me floated and take all the money.”
“I brought you the letter,” Adam said patiently.
“I want to know why.”
Adam said, “I’m not interested in what you think or in what you think of me. Charles left you the

money in his will. He didn’t put any strings on it. I haven’t seen the will, but he wanted you to
have the money.”
“You’re playing a close game with fifty thousand dollars,” she said, “and you’re not going to get
away with it. I don’t know what the trick is, but I’m going to find out.” And then she said, “What
am I thinking about? You’re not smart. Who’s advising you?”
“No one.”
“How about that Chinaman? He’s smart.”
“He gave me no advice.” Adam was interested in his own complete lack of emotion. He didn’t
really feel that he was here at all. When he glanced at her he surprised an emotion on her face he
had never seen before. Kate was afraid—she was afraid of him. But why?
She controlled her face and whipped the fear from it. “You’re just doing it because you’re honest,
is that it? You’re just too sugar sweet to live.”
“I hadn’t thought of it,” Adam said. “It’s your mon-ey and I’m not a thief. It doesn’t matter to me
what you think about it.”
Kate pushed the eyeshade back on her head. “You want me to think you’re just dropping this
money in my lap. Well, I’ll find out what you’re up to. Don’t think I won’t take care of myself.
Did you think I’d take such a stupid bait?”
“Where do you get your mail?” he asked patiently. “What’s that to you?”
“I’ll write the lawyers where to get in touch with you.”
“Don’t you do it!” she said. She put the letter in the account book and closed the cover. “I’ll keep
this. I’ll get legal advice. Don’t think I won’t. You can drop the innocence now.”
“You do that,” Adam said. “I want you to have what is yours. Charles willed you the money. It
isn’t mine.”
“I’ll find the trick. I’ll find it.”
Adam said, “I guess you can’t understand it. I don’t much care. There are so many things I don’t
under-stand. I don’t understand how you could shoot me and desert your sons. I don’t understand
how you or anyone could live like this.” He waved his hand to indicate the house.
“Who asked you to understand?”
Adam stood up and took his hat from the table. “I guess that’s all,” he said. “Good-by.” He
walked toward the door.
She called after him, “You’re changed, Mr. Mouse. Have you got a woman at last?” Adam
stopped and slowly turned and his eyes were thoughtful. “I hadn’t considered before,” he said,
and he moved toward her until he towered over her and she had to tilt back her head to look into
his face. “I said I didn’t understand about you,” he said slowly. “Just now it came to me what you
don’t understand.”
“What don’t I understand, Mr. Mouse?”
“You know about the ugliness in people. You showed me the pictures. You use all the sad, weak
parts of a man, and God knows he has them.”
“Everybody—”
Adam went on, astonished at his own thoughts, “But you—yes, that’s right—you don’t know

about the rest. You don’t believe I brought you the letter because I don’t want your money. You
don’t believe I loved you. And the men who come to you here with their ugliness, the men in the
pictures—you don’t believe those men could have goodness and beauty in them. You see only
one side, and you think—more than that, you’re sure—that’s all there is.”
She cackled at him derisively. “In sticks and stones. What a sweet dreamer is Mr. Mouse! Give
me a ser-mon, Mr. Mouse.”
“No. I won’t because I seem to know that there’s a part of you missing. Some men can’t see the
color green, but they may never know they can’t. I think you are only a part of a human. I can’t
do anything about that. But I wonder whether you ever feel that some-thing invisible is all around
you. It would be horrible if you knew it was there and couldn’t see it or feel it. That would be
horrible.”
Kate pushed back her chair and stood up. Her fists were clenched at her sides and hiding in the
folds of her skirt. She tried to prevent the shrillness that crept into her voice.
“Our Mouse is a philosopher,” she said. “But our Mouse is no better at that than he is at other
things. Did you ever hear of hallucinations? If there are things I can’t see, don’t you think it’s
possible that they are dreams manufactured in your own sick mind?”
“No, I don’t,” said Adam. “No, I don’t. And I don’t think you do either.” He turned and went out
and closed the door behind him.
Kate sat down and stared at the closed door. She was not aware that her fists beat softly on the
White oilcloth. But she did know that the square white door was distorted by tears and that her
body shook with something that felt like rage and also felt like sorrow.

2
When Adam left Kate’s place he had over two hours to wait for the train back to King City. On
an impulse he turned off Main Street and walked up Central Avenue to number 130, the high
white house of Ernest Stein-beck. It was an immaculate and friendly house, grand enough but not
pretentious, and it sat inside its white fence, surrounded by its clipped lawn, and roses and
catoneasters lapped against its white walls.
Adam walked up the wide veranda steps and rang the bell. Olive came to the door and opened it a
little, while Mary and John peeked around the edges of her.
Adam took off his hat. “You don’t know me. I’m Adam Trask. Your father was a friend of mine.
I thought I’d like to pay my respects to Mrs. Hamilton. She helped me with the twins.”
“Why, of course,” Olive said and swung the wide doors open. “We’ve heard about you. Just a
moment. You see, we’ve made a kind of retreat for Mother.”
She knocked on a door off the wide front hall and called, “Mother! There’s a friend to see you.”
She opened the door and showed Adam into the pleasant room where Liza lived. “You’ll have to
excuse me,” she said to Adam. “Catrina’s frying chicken and I have to watch her. John! Mary!
Come along. Come along.”
Liza seemed smaller than ever. She sat in a wicker rocking chair and she was old and old. Her
dress was a full wide-skirted black alpaca, and at her throat she wore a pin which spelled

“Mother” in golden script.
The pleasant little bed-sitting room was crowded with photographs, bottles of toilet water, lace
pincush-ions, brushes and combs, and the china and silver bureau-knacks of many birthdays and
Christmases.
On the wall hung a huge tinted photograph of Samuel, which had captured a cold and aloof
dignity, a scrubbed and dressed remoteness, which did not belong to him living. There was no
twinkle in the picture of him, nor any of his inspective joyousness. The picture hung in a heavy
gold frame, and to the consternation of all children its eyes followed a child about the room.
On a wicker table beside Liza was the cage of Polly parrot. Tom had bought the parrot from a
sailor. He was an old bird, reputed to be fifty years old, and he had lived a ribald life and acquired
the vigorous speech of a ship’s fo’c’sle. Try as she would, Liza could not make him substitute
psalms for the picturesque vocabu-lary of his youth.
Polly cocked his head sideways, inspecting Adam, and scratched the feathers at the base of his
beak with a careful foreclaw. “Come off it, you bastard,” said Polly unemotionally.
Liza frowned at him. “Polly,” she said sternly, “that’s not polite.”
“Bloody bastard!” Polly observed.
Liza ignored the vulgarity. She held out her tiny hand. “Mr. Trask,” she said, “I’m glad to see
you. Sit down, won’t you?”
“I was passing by, and I wanted to offer my condo-lences.”
“We got your flowers.” And she remembered, too, every bouquet after all this time. Adam had
sent a fine pillow of everlastings.
“It must be hard to rearrange your life.”
Liza’s eyes brimmed over and she snapped her little mouth shut on her weakness.
Adam said, “Maybe I shouldn’t bring up your hurt, but I miss him.”
Liza turned her head away. “How is everything down your way?” she asked.
“Good this year. Lots of rainfall. The feed’s deep already.”
“Tom wrote me,” she said.
“Button up,” said the parrot, and Liza scowled at him as she had at her growing children when
they were mutinous.
“What brings you up to Salinas, Mr. Trask?” she asked.
“Why, some business.” He sat down in a wicker chair and it cricked under his weight. “I’m
thinking of moving up here. Thought it might be better for my boys. They get lonely on the
ranch.”
“We never got lonely on the ranch,” she said harshly.
“I thought maybe the schools would be better here. My twins could have the advantages.”
“My daughter Olive taught at Peachtree and Pleyto and the Big Sur.” Her tone made it clear that
there were no better schools than those. Adam began to feel a warm admiration for her iron
gallantry.
“Well, I was just thinking about it,” he said.
“Children raised in the country do better.” It was the law, and she could prove it by her own boys.

Then she centered closely on him. “Are you looking for a house in Salinas?”
“Well, yes, I guess I am.”
“Go see my daughter Dessie,” she said. “Dessie wants to move back to the ranch with Tom. She’s
got a nice little house up the street next to Reynaud’s Bak-ery.”
“I’ll certainly do that,” said Adam. “I’ll go now. I’m glad to see you doing so well.”
“Thank you,” she said. “I’m comfortable.” Adam was moving toward the door when she said,
“Mr. Trask, do you ever see my son Tom?”
“Well, no, I don’t. You see, I haven’t been off the ranch.”
“I wish you would go and see him,” she said quick-ly. “I think he’s lonely.” She stopped as
though hor-rified at this breaking over.
“I will. I surely will. Good-by, ma’am.”
As he closed the door he heard the parrot say, “Button up, you bloody bastard!” And Liza, “Polly,
if you don’t watch your language, I’ll thrash you.”
Adam let himself out of the house and walked up the evening street toward Main. Next to
Reynaud’s French Bakery he saw Dessie’s house set back in its little garden. The yard was so
massed with tall privets that he couldn’t see much of the house. A neatly painted sign was
screwed to the front gate. It read: Dessie Hamilton, Dressmaker.
The San Francisco Chop House was on the corner of Main and Central and its windows were on
both streets. Adam went in to get some dinner. Will Hamil-ton sat at the corner table, devouring a
rib steak. “Come and sit with me,” he called to Adam. “Up on business?”
“Yes,” said Adam. “I went to pay a call on your mother.”
Will laid down his fork. “I’m just up here for an hour. I didn’t go to see her because it gets her
excited. And my sister Olive would tear the house down getting a special dinner for me. I just
didn’t want to disturb them. Besides, I have to go right back. Order a rib steak. They’ve got good
ones. How is Mother?”
“She’s got great courage,” said Adam. “I find I ad-mire her more all the time.”
“That she has. How she kept her good sense with all of us and with my father, I don’t know.”
“Rib steak, medium,” said Adam to the waiter.
“Potatoes?”
“No—yes, french fried. Your mother is worried about Tom. Is he all right?”
Will cut off the edging of fat from his steak and pushed it to the side of his plate. “She’s got
reason to worry,” he said. “Something’s the matter with Tom. He’s moping around like a
monument.”
“I guess he depended on Samuel.”
“Too much,” said Will. “Far too much. He can’t seem to come out of it. In some ways Tom is a
great big baby.”
“I’ll go and see him. Your mother says Dessie is going to move back to the ranch.”
Will laid his knife and fork down on the tablecloth and stared at Adam. “She can’t do it,” he said.
“I won’t let her do it.”
“Why not?”

Will covered up. “Well,” he said, “she’s got a nice business here. Makes a good living. It would
be a shame to throw it away.” He picked up his knife and fork, cut off a piece of the fat, and put it
in his mouth.
“I’m catching the eight o’clock home,” Adam said.
“So am I,” said Will. He didn’t want to talk any more.

Chapter 32
1
Dessie was the beloved of the family. Mollie the pretty kitten, Olive the strong-headed, Una with
clouds on her head, all were loved, but Dessie was the warm-beloved. Hers was the twinkle and
the laughter infectious as chickenpox, and hers the gaiety that colored a day and spread to people
so that they carried it away with them.
I can put it this way. Mrs. Clarence Morrison of 122 Church Street, Salinas, had three children
and a hus-band who ran a dry goods store. On certain mornings, at breakfast, Agnes Morrison
would say, “I’m going to Dessie Hamilton’s for a fitting after dinner.”
The children would be glad and would kick their copper toes against the table legs until
cautioned. And Mr. Morrison would rub his palms together and go to his store, hoping some
drummer would come by that day. And any drummer who did come by was likely to get a good
order. Maybe the children and Mr. Morrison would forget why it was a good day with a promise
on its tail.
Mrs. Morrison would go to the house next to Reynaud’s Bakery at two o’clock and she would
stay until four. When she came out her eyes would be wet with tears and her nose red and
streaming. Walking home, she would dab her nose and wipe her eyes and laugh all over again.
Maybe all Dessie had done was to put several black pins in a cushion to make it look like the
Baptist minister, and then had the pincushion deliver a short dry sermon. Maybe she had
recounted a meeting with Old Man Taylor, who bought old houses and moved them to a big
vacant lot he owned until he had so many it looked like a dry-land Sargasso Sea. Maybe she had
read a poem from Chatterbox with gestures. It didn’t matter. It was warm-funny, it was catching
funny.
The Morrison children, coming home from school, would find no aches, no carping, no headache.
Their noise was not a scandal nor their dirty faces a care. And when the giggles overcame them,
why, their moth-er was giggling too.
Mr. Morrison, coming home, would tell of the day and get listened to, and he would try to retell
the drummer’s stories—some of them at least. The supper would be delicious—omelets never fell
and cakes rose to balloons of lightness, biscuits fluffed up, and no one could season a stew like
Agnes Morrison. After supper, when the children had laughed themselves to sleep, like as not Mr.
Morrison would touch Agnes on the shoulder in their old, old signal and they would go to bed
and make love and be very happy.
The visit to Dessie might carry its charge into two days more before it petered out and the little
headaches came back and business was not so good as last year. That’s how Dessie was and
that’s what she could do. She carried excitement in her arms just as Samuel had. She was the

darling, she was the beloved of the family.
Dessie was not beautiful. Perhaps she wasn’t even pretty, but she had the glow that makes men
follow a woman in the hope of reflecting a little of it. You would have thought that in time she
would have got over her first love affair and found another love, but she did not. Come to think of
it, none of the Hamiltons, with all their versatility, had any versatility in love. None of them
seemed capable of light or changeable love.
Dessie did not simply throw up her hands and give up. It was much worse than that. She went
right on doing and being what she was—without the glow. The people who loved her ached for
her, seeing her try, and they got to trying for her.
Dessie’s friends were good and loyal but they were human, and humans love to feel good and
they hate to feel bad. In time the Mrs. Morrisons found unassailable reasons for not going to the
little house by the bakery. They weren’t disloyal. They didn’t want to be sad as much as they
wanted to be happy. It is easy to find a logical and virtuous reason for not doing what you don’t
want to do.
Dessie’s business began to fall off. And the women who had thought they wanted dresses never
realized that what they had wanted was happiness. Times were changing and the ready-made
dress was becoming pop-ular. It was no longer a disgrace to wear one. If Mr. Morrison was
stocking ready-mades, it was only rea-sonable that Agnes Morrison should be seen in them.
The family was worried about Dessie, but what could you do when she would not admit there
was anything wrong with her? She did admit to pains in her side, quite fierce, but they lasted only
a little while and came only at intervals.
Then Samuel died and the world shattered like a dish. His sons and daughters and friends groped
about among the pieces, trying to put some kind of world together again.
Dessie decided to sell her business and go back to the ranch to live with Tom. She hadn’t much
of any busi-ness to sell out. Liza knew about it, and Olive, and Dessie had written to Tom. But
Will, sitting scowling at the table in the San Francisco Chop House, had not been told. Will
frothed inwardly and finally he balled up his napkin and got up. “I forgot something,” he said to
Adam. “I’ll see you on the train.”
He walked the half-block to Dessie’s house and went through the high grown garden and rang
Dessie’s bell.
She was having her dinner alone, and she came to the door with her napkin in her hand. “Why,
hello, Will,” she said and put up her pink cheek for him to kiss. “When did you get in town?”
“Business,” he said. “Just here between trains. I want to talk to you.”
She led him back to her kitchen and dining-room combined, a warm little room papered with
flowers. Automatically she poured a cup of coffee and placed it for him and put the sugar bowl
and the cream pitcher in front of it.
“Have you seen Mother?” she asked.
“I’m just here over trains,” he said gruffly. “Dessie, is it true you want to go back to the ranch?”
“I was thinking of it.”
“I don’t want you to go.”

She smiled uncertainly. “Why not? What’s wrong with that? Tom’s lonely down there.”
“You’ve got a nice business here,” he said.
“I haven’t any business here,” she replied. “I thought you knew that.”
“I don’t want you to go,” he repeated sullenly.
Her smile was wistful and she tried her best to put a little mockery in her manner. “My big
brother is mas-terful. Tell Dessie why not.”
“It’s too lonely down there.”
“It won’t be as lonely with the two of us.”
Will pulled at his lips angrily. He blurted, “Tom’s not himself. You shouldn’t be alone with him.”
“Isn’t he well? Does he need help?”
Will said, “I didn’t want to tell you—I don’t think Tom’s ever got over—the death. He’s strange.”
She smiled affectionately. “Will, you’ve always thought he was strange. You thought he was
strange when he didn’t like business.”
“That was different. But now he’s broody. He doesn’t talk. He goes walking alone in the hills at
night. I went out to see him and—he’s been writing poetry—pages of it all over the table.”
“Didn’t you ever write poetry, Will?”
“I did not.”
“I have,” said Dessie. “Pages and pages of it all over the table.”
“I don’t want you to go.”
“Let me decide,” she said softly. “I’ve lost some-thing. I want to try to find it again.”
“You’re talking foolish.”
She came around the table and put her arms around his neck. “Dear brother,” she said, “please let
me de-cide.”
He went angrily out of the house and barely caught his train.

2
Tom met Dessie at the King City station. She saw him out of the train window, scanning every
coach for her. He was burnished, his face shaved so close that its darkness had a shine like
polished wood. His red mustache was clipped. He wore a new Stetson hat with a flat crown, a tan
Norfolk jacket with a belt buckle of mother-of-pearl. His shoes glinted in the noonday light so
that it was sure he had gone over them with his handkerchief just before the train arrived. His
hard collar stood up against his strong red neck, and he wore a pale blue knitted tie with a
horseshoe tie pin. He tried to conceal his excitement by clasping his rough brown hands in front
of him.
Dessie waved wildly out the window, crying, “Here I am, Tom, here I am!” though she knew he
couldn’t hear her over the grinding wheels of the train as the coach slid past him. She climbed
down the steps and saw him looking frantically about in the wrong direc-tion. She smiled and
walked up behind him.
“I beg your pardon, stranger,” she said quietly. “Is there a Mister Tom Hamilton here?”
He spun around and he squealed with pleasure and picked her up in a bear hug and danced around

her. He held her off the ground with one arm and spanked her bottom with his free hand. He
nuzzled her cheek with his harsh mustache. Then he held her back by the shoulders and looked at
her. Both of them threw back their heads and howled with laughter.
The station agent leaned out his window and rested his elbows, protected with black false sleeves,
on the sill. He said over his shoulder to the telegrapher, “Those Hamiltons! Just look at them!”
Tom and Dessie, fingertips touching, were doing a courtly heel-and-toe while he sang Doodledoodle-doo and Dessie sang Deedle-deedle-dee, and then they em-braced again.
Tom looked down at her. “Aren’t you Dessie Hamil-ton? I seem to remember you. But you’ve
changed. Where are your pigtails?”
It took him quite a fumbling time to get her luggage checks, to lose them in his pockets, to find
them and pick up the wrong pieces. At last he had her baskets piled in the back of the buckboard.
The two bay horses pawed the hard ground and threw up their heads so that the shined pole
jumped and the doubletrees squeaked. The harness was polished and the horse brasses glittered
like gold. There was a red bow tied halfway up the buggy whip and red ribbons were braided into
the horses’ manes and tails.
Tom helped Dessie into the seat and pretended to peek coyly at her ankle. Then he snapped up
the check reins and unfastened the leather tie reins from the bits. He unwrapped the lines from the
whip stock, and the horses turned so sharply that the wheel screamed against the guard.
Tom said, “Would you care to make a tour of King City? It’s a lovely town.”
“No,” she said. “I think I remember it.” He turned left and headed south and lifted the horses to a
fine swinging trot.
Dessie said, “Where’s Will?”
“I don’t know,” he answered gruffly. “Did he talk to you?”
“Yes. He said you shouldn’t come.”
“He told me the same thing,” said Dessie. “He got George to write to me too.”
“Why shouldn’t you come if you want to?” Tom raged. “What’s Will got to do with it?”
She touched his arm. “He thinks you’re crazy. Says you’re writing poetry.”
Tom’s face darkened. “He must have gone in the house when I wasn’t there. What’s he want
anyway? He had no right to look at my papers.”
“Gently, gently,” said Dessie. “Will’s your brother. Don’t forget that.”
“How would he like me to go through his papers?” Tom demanded.
“He wouldn’t let you,” Dessie said dryly. “They’d be locked in the safe. Now let’s not spoil the
day with anger.”
“All right,” he said. “God knows all right! But he makes me mad. If I don’t want to live his kind
of life I’m crazy—just crazy.”
Dessie changed the subject, forced the change. “You know, I had quite a time at the last,” she
said. “Mother wanted to come. Have you ever seen Mother cry, Tom?”
“No, not that I can remember. No, she’s not a crier.”
“Well, she cried. Not much, but a lot for her—a choke and two sniffles and a wiped nose and
polished her glasses and snapped shut like a watch.”

Tom said, “Oh, Lord, Dessie, it’s good to have you back! It’s good. Makes me feel I’m well from
a sick-ness.”
The horses spanked along the county road. Tom said, “Adam Trask has bought a Ford. Or maybe
I should say Will sold him a Ford.”
“I didn’t know about the Ford,” said Dessie. “He’s buying my house. Giving me a very good
price for it.” She laughed. “I put a very high price on the house. I was going to come down during
negotiations. Mr. Trask accepted the first price. It put me in a fix.”
“What did you do, Dessie?”
“Well, I had to tell him about the high price and that I had planned to be argued down. He didn’t
seem to care either way.”
Tom said, “Let me beg you never to tell that story to Will. He’d have you locked up.”
“But the house wasn’t worth what I asked!”
“I repeat what I said about Will. What’s Adam want with your house?”
“He’s going to move there. Wants the twins to go to school in Salinas.”
“What’ll he do with his ranch?”
“I don’t know. He didn’t say.”
Tom said, “I wonder what would have happened if Father’d got hold of a ranch like that instead
of Old Dry and Dusty.”
“It isn’t such a bad place.”
“Fine for everything except making a living.”
Dessie said earnestly, “Have you ever known any family that had more fun?”
“No, I don’t. But that was the family, not the land.”
“Tom, remember when you took Jenny and Belle Williams to the Peachtree dance on the sofa?”
“Mother never let me forget it. Say, wouldn’t it be good to ask Jenny and Belle down for a visit?”
“They’d come too,” Dessie said. “Let’s do it.”
When they turned off the county road she said, “Somehow I remember it differently.”
“Drier?”
“I guess that’s it. Tom, there’s so much grass.”
“I’m getting twenty head of stock to eat it.”
“You must be rich.”
“No, and the good year will break the price of beef. I wonder what Will would do. He’s a scarcity
man. He told me. He said, ‘Always deal in scarcities.’ Will’s smart.”
The rutty road had not changed except that the ruts were deeper and the round stones stuck up
higher.
Dessie said, “What’s the card on that mesquite bush?” She picked it off as they drove by, and it
said, “Welcome Home.”
“Tom, you did it!”
“I did not. Someone’s been here.”
Every fifty yards there was another card sticking on a bush, or hanging from the branches of a
madrone, or tacked to the trunk of a buckeye, and all of them said, “Welcome Home.” Dessie

squealed with delight over each one.
They topped the rise above the little valley of the old Hamilton place and Tom pulled up to let her
enjoy the view. On the hill across the valley, spelled out in white-washed stones, were the huge
words, “Welcome Home, Dessie.” She put her head against his lapel and laughed and cried at the
same time.
Tom looked sternly ahead of him. “Now who could have done that?” he said. “A man can’t leave
the place any more.”
In the dawn Dessie was awakened by the chill of pain that came to her at intervals. It was a rustle
and a threat of pain; it scampered up from her side and across her abdomen, a nibbling pinch and
then a little grab and then a hard catch and finally a fierce grip as though a huge hand had
wrenched her. When that relaxed she felt a soreness like a bruise. It didn’t last very long, but
while it went on the outside world was blotted out, and she seemed to be listening to the struggle
in her body. When only the soreness remained she saw how the dawn had come silver to the
windows. She smelled the good morning wind rippling the curtains, bringing in the odor of grass
and roots and damp earth. After that sounds joined the parade of perception—sparrows hag-gling
among themselves, a bawling cow monotonously beratine a punching hungry calf, a blue jay’s
squawk of false excitement, the sharp warning of a cock quail on guard and the answering
whisper of the hen quail somewhere near in the tall grass. The chickenyard boiled with
excitement over an egg, and a big lady Rhode Island Red, who weighed four pounds, hypocritically protested the horror of being lustfully pinned to the ground by a scrawny wreck of a rooster
she could have blasted with one blow of her wing.
The cooing of pigeons brought memory into the procession. Dessie remembered how her father
had said, sitting at the head of the table, “I told Rabbit I was going to raise some pigeons and—do
you know?—he said, ‘No white pigeons.’ ‘Why not white?’ I asked him, and he said, ‘They’re
the rare worst of bad luck. You take a flight of white pigeons and they’ll bring sadness and death.
Get gray ones.’ ‘Ilike white ones.’ ‘Get gray ones,’ he told me. And as the sky covers me, I’ll get
white ones.”
And Liza said patiently, “Why do you be forever testing, Samuel? Gray ones taste just as good
and they’re bigger.”
“I’ll let no flimsy fairy tale push me,” Samuel said.
And Liza said with her dreadful simplicity, “You’re already pushed by your own contentiousness.
You’re a mule of contention, a very mule!”
“Someone’s got to do these things,” he said sullenly. “Else Fate would not ever get nose-thumbed
and man-kind would still be clinging to the top branches of a tree.”
And of course he got white pigeons and waited truc-ulently for sadness and death until he’d
proved his point. And here were the great-great-grand squabs cooing in the morning and rising to
fly like a whirling white scarf around the wagon shed.
As Dessie remembered, she heard the words and the house around her grew peopled. Sadness and
death, she thought, and death and sadness, and it wrenched in her stomach against the soreness.
You just have to wait around long enough and it will come.

She heard the air whooshing into the big bellows in the forge and the practice tap for range of
hammer on anvil. She heard Liza open the oven door and the thump of a kneaded loaf on the
floury board. Then Joe wandered about, looking in unlikely places for his shoes, and at last found
them where he had left them under the bed.
She heard Mollie’s sweet high voice in the kitchen, reading a morning text from the Bible, and
Una’s full cold throaty correction.
And Tom had cut Mollie’s tongue with his pocketknife and died in his heart when he realized his
courage.
“Oh, dear Tom,” she said, and her lips moved.
Tom’s cowardice was as huge as his courage, as it must be in great men. His violence balanced
his tender-ness, and himself was a pitted battlefield of his own forces. He was confused now, but
Dessie could hold his bit and point him, the way a handler points a thorough-bred at the barrier to
show his breeding and his form.
Dessie lay part in pain and a part of her dangled still in sleep while the morning brightened
against the win-dow. She remembered that Mollie was going to lead the Grand March at the
Fourth of July picnic with no less than Harry Forbes, State Senator. And Dessie had not finished
putting the braid on Mollie’s dress. She strug-gled to get up. There was so much braid, and here
she lay drowsing.
She cried, “I’ll get it done, Mollie. It will be ready.”
She got up from her bed and threw her robe around her and walked barefooted through the house
crowded with Hamiltons. In the hall they were gone to the bedrooms. In the bedrooms, with the
beds neat-made, they were all in the kitchen, and in the kitchen—they dispersed and were gone.
Sadness and death. The wave receded and left her in dry awakeness.
The house was clean, scrubbed and immaculate, cur-tains washed, windows polished, but all as a
man does it—the ironed curtains did not hang quite straight and there were streaks on the
windows and a square showed on the table when a book was moved.
The stove was warming, with orange light showing around the lids and the soft thunder of drafty
flame leaping past the open damper. The kitchen clock flashed its pendulum behind its glass skirt,
and it ticked like a little wooden hammer striking on an empty wood-en box.
From outside came a whistle as wild and raucous as a reed and pitched high and strange. The
whistling scat-tered a savage melody. Then Tom’s steps sounded on the porch, and he came in
with an armload of oakwood so high he could not see over it. He cascaded the wood into the
woodbox.
“You’re up,” he said. “That was to wake you if you were still sleeping.” His face was lighted
with joy. “This is a morning light as down and no time to be slugging.”
“You sound like your father,” Dessie said, and she laughed with him.
His joy hardened to fierceness. “Yes,” he said loud-ly. “And we’ll have that time again, right
here. I’ve been dragging myself in misery like a spine-broken snake. No wonder Will thought I
was cracked. But now you’re back, and I’ll show you. I’ll breathe life into life again. Do you
hear? This house is going to be alive.”

“I’m glad I came,” she said, and she thought in desolation how brittle he was now and how easy
to shatter, and how she would have to protect him.
“You must have worked day and night to get the house so clean,” she said.
“Nothing,” said Tom. “A little twist with the fingers.”
“I know that twist, but it was with bucket and mop and on your knees—unless you’ve invented
some way to do it by chicken power or the harnessed wind.”
“Invented—now that’s why I have no time. I’ve invented a little slot that lets a necktie slip
around freely in a stiff collar.”
“You don’t wear stiff collars.”
“I did yesterday. That’s when I invented it. And chickens—I’m going to raise millions of them—
little houses all over the ranch and a ring on the roof to dip them in a whitewash tank. And eggs
will come through on a little conveyor belt—here! I’ll draw it.”
“I want to draw some breakfast,” Dessie said. “What’s the shape of a fried egg? How would you
color the fat and lean of a strip of bacon?”
“You’ll have it,” he cried, and he opened the stove lid and assaulted the fire with the stove lifter
until the hairs on his hand curled and charred. He pitched wood in and started his high whistling.
Dessie said, “You sound like some goat-foot with a wheat flute on a hill in Greece.”
“What do you think I am?” he shouted.
Dessie thought miserably, If his is real, why can’t my heart be light? Why can’t I climb out of my
gray ragbag? I will, she screeched inside herself. If he can—I will.
She said, “Tom!”
“Yes.”
“I want a purple egg.”

Chapter 33
1
The green lasted on the hills far into June before the grass turned yellow. The heads of the wild
oats were so heavy with seed that they hung over on their stalks. The little springs trickled on late
in the summer. The range cattle staggered under their fat and their hides shone with health. It was
a year when the people of the Salinas Valley forgot the dry years. Farmers bought more land than
they could afford and figured their profits on the covers of their checkbooks.
Tom Hamilton labored like a giant, not only with his strong arms and rough hands but also with
his heart and spirit. The anvil rang in the forge again. He paint-ed the old house white and
whitewashed the sheds. He went to King City and studied a flush toilet and then built one of
craftily bent tin and carved wood. Because the water came so slowly from the spring, he put a
redwood tank beside the house and pumped the water up to it with a handmade windmill so
cleverly made that it turned in the slightest wind. And he made metal and wood models of two
ideas to be sent to the patent office in the fall.
That was not all—he labored with humor and good spirits. Dessie had to rise very early to get in
her hand at the housework before Tom had it all done. She watched his great red happiness, and it
was not light as Samuel’s happiness was light. It did not rise out of his roots and come floating
up. He was manufacturing happiness as cleverly as he knew how, molding it and shaping it.
Dessie, who had more friends than anyone in the whole valley, had no confidants. When her
trouble had come upon her she had not talked about it. And the pains were a secret in herself.
When Tom found her rigid and tight from the grabbing pain and cried in alarm, “Dessie, what’s
the mat-ter?” she controlled her face and said, “A little crick, that’s all. Just a little crick. I’m all
right now.” And in a moment they were laughing.
They laughed a great deal, as though to reassure themselves. Only when Dessie went to her bed
did her loss fall on her, bleak and unendurable. And Tom lay in the dark of his room, puzzled as a
child. He could hear his heart beating and rasping a little in its beat. His mind fell away from
thought and clung for safety to little plans, designs, machines.
Sometimes in the summer evenings they walked up the hill to watch the afterglow clinging to the
tops of the western mountains and to feel the breeze drawn into the valley by the rising dayheated air. Usually they stood silently for a while and breathed in peacefulness. Since both were
shy they never talked about themselves. Neither knew about the other at all.
It was startling to both of them when Dessie said one evening on the hill, “Tom, why don’t you
get mar-ried?”
He looked quickly at her and away. He said, “Who’d have me?”
“Is that a joke or do you really mean it?”

“Who’d have me?” he said again. “Who’d want a thing like me?”
“It sounds to me as though you really mean it.” Then she violated their unstated code. “Have you
been in love with someone?”
“No,” he said shortly.
“I wish I knew,” she said as though he had not answered.
Tom did not speak again as they walked down the hill. But on the porch he said suddenly,
“You’re lonely here. You don’t want to stay.” He waited for a mo-ment. “Answer me. Isn’t that
true?”
“I want to stay here more than I want to stay any-place else.” She asked, “Do you ever go to
women?”
“Yes,” he said.
“Is it any good to you?”
“Not much.”
“What are you going to do?”
“I don’t know.”
In silence they went back to the house. Tom lighted the lamp in the old living room. The
horsehair sofa he had rebuilt raised its gooseneck against the wall, and the green carpet had tracks
worn light between the doors.
Tom sat down by the round center table. Dessie sat on the sofa, and she could see that he was still
embar-rassed from his last admission. She thought, How pure he is, how unfit for a world that
even she knew more about than he did. A dragon killer, he was, a rescuer of damsels, and his
small sins seemed so great to him that he felt unfit and unseemly. She wished her father were
here. Her father had felt greatness in Tom. Perhaps he would know now how to release it out of
its darkness and let it fly free.
She took another tack to see whether she could raise some spark in him. “As long as we’re
talking about ourselves, have you ever thought that our whole world is the valley and a few trips
to San Francisco, and have you ever been farther south than San Luis Obispo? I never have.”
“Neither have I,” said Tom.
“Well, isn’t that silly?”
“Lots of people haven’t,” he said.
“But it’s not a law. We could go to Paris and to Rome or to Jerusalem. I would dearly love to see
the Colosseum.”
He watched her suspiciously, expecting some kind of joke. “How could we?” he asked. “That
takes a lot of money.”
“I don’t think it does,” she said. “We wouldn’t have to stay in fancy places. We could take the
cheapest boats and the lowest class. That’s how our father came here from Ireland. And we could
go to Ireland.”
Still he watched her, but a burning was beginning in his eyes.
Dessie went on, “We could take a year for work, save every penny. I can get some sewing to do
in King City. Will would help us. And next summer you could sell all the stock and we could go.

There’s no law forbids it.”
Tom got up and went outside. He looked up at the summer stars, at blue Venus and red Mars. His
hands flexed at his sides, closed to fists and opened. Then he turned and went back into the
house. Dessie had not moved.
“Do you want to go, Dessie?”
“More than anything in the world.”
“Then we will go!”
“Do you want to go?”
“More than anything in the world,” he said, and then, “Egypt—have you given a thought to
Egypt?”
“Athens,” she said.
“Constantinople!”
“Bethlehem!”
“Yes, Bethlehem,” said he suddenly, “Go to bed. We’ve got a year of work—a year. Get some
rest. I’m going to borrow money from Will to buy a hundred shoats.”
“What will you feed them?”
“Acorns,” said Tom. “I’ll make a machine to gather acorns.”
After he had gone to his room she could hear him knocking around and talking softly to himself.
Dessie looked out her window at the starlit night and she was glad. But she wondered whether
she really wanted to go, or whether Tom did. And as she wondered the whisper of pain grew up
from her side.
When Dessie got up in the morning Tom was already at his drawing board, beating his forehead
with his fist and growling to himself. Dessie looked over his shoul-der. “Is it the acorn machine?”
“It should be easy,” he said. “But how to get out the sticks and rocks?”
“I know you’re the inventor, but I invented the greatest acorn picker in the world and it’s ready to
go.”
“What do you mean?”
“Children,” she said. “Those restless little hands.”
“They wouldn’t do it, not even for pay.”
“They would for prizes. A prize for everyone and a big prize for the winner—maybe a hundreddollar prize. They’d sweep the valley clean. Will you let me try?”
He scratched his head. “Why not?” he said. “But how would you collect the acorns?”
“The children will bring them in,” said Dessie. “Just let me take care of it. I hope you have plenty
of storage space.”
“It would be exploiting the young, wouldn’t it?”
“Certainly it would,” Dessie agreed. “When I had my shop I exploited the girls who wanted to
learn to sew—and they exploited me. I think I will call this The Great Monterey County Acorn
Contest. And I won’t let everyone in. Maybe bicycles for prizes—wouldn’t you pick up acorns in
hope of a bicycle, Tom?”
“Sure I would,” he said. “But couldn’t we pay them too?”

“Not with money,” Dessie said. “That would reduce it to labor, and they will not labor if they can
help it, Nor will I.”
Tom leaned back from his board and laughed. “Nor will I,” he said. “All right, you are in charge
of acorns and I am in charge of pigs.”
Dessie said, “Tom, wouldn’t it be ridiculous if we made money, we of all people?”
“But you made money in Salinas,” he said.
“Some—not much. But oh, I was rich in promises. If the bills had ever been paid we wouldn’t
need pigs. We could go to Paris tomorrow.”
“I’m going to drive in and talk to Will,” said Tom. He pushed his chair back from the drawing
board. “Want to come with me?”
“No, I’ll stay and make my plans. Tomorrow I start The Great Acorn Contest.”

2
On the ride back to the ranch in the late afternoon Tom was depressed and sad. As always, Will
had man-aged to chew up and spit out his enthusiasm. Will had pulled his lip, rubbed his
eyebrows, scratched his nose, cleaned his glasses, and made a major operation of cutting and
lighting a cigar. The pig proposition was full of holes, and Will was able to put his fingers in the
holes.
The Acorn Contest wouldn’t work although he was not explicit about why it wouldn’t. The whole
thing was shaky, particularly in these times. The very best Will was able to do was to agree to
think about it.
At one time during the talk Tom had thought to tell Will about Europe, but a quick instinct
stopped him. The idea of traipsing around Europe, unless, of course, you were retired and had
your capital out in good secur-ities, would be to Will a craziness that would make the pig plan a
marvel of business acumen. Tom did not tell him, and he left Will to “think it over,” knowing that
the verdict would be against the pigs and the acorns.
Poor Tom did not know and could not learn that dissembling successfully is one of the creative
joys of a businessman. To indicate enthusiasm was to be idiotic. And Will really did mean to
think it over. Parts of the plan fascinated him. Tom had stumbled on a very interesting thing. If
you could buy shoats on credit, fatten them on food that cost next to nothing, sell them, pay off
your loan, and take your profit, you would really have done something. Will would not rob his
brother. He would cut him in on the profits, but Tom was a dreamer and could not be trusted with
a good sound plan. Tom, for instance, didn’t even know the price of pork and its probable trend.
If it worked out, Will could be depended on to give Tom a very sub-stantial present—maybe even
a Ford. And how about a Ford as first and only prize for acorns? Everybody in the whole valley
would pick acorns.
Driving up the Hamilton road, Tom wondered how to break it to Dessie that their plan was no
good. The best way would be to have another plan to substitute for it. How could they make
enough money in one year to go to Europe? And suddenly he realized that he didn’t know how
much they’d need. He didn’t know the price of a steamship ticket. They might spend the evening

figuring.
He half expected Dessie to run out of the house when he drove up. He would put on his best face
and tell a joke. But Dessie didn’t run out. Maybe taking a nap, he thought. He watered the horses
and stabled them and pitched hay into the manger.
Dessie was lying on the gooseneck sofa when Tom came in. “Taking a nap?” he asked, and then
he saw the color of her face. “Dessie,” he cried, “what’s the matter?”
She rallied herself against pain. “Just a stomach ache,” she said. “A pretty severe one.”
“Oh,” said Tom. “You scared me. I can fix up a stomach ache.” He went to the kitchen and
brought back a glass of pearly liquid. He handed it to her.
“What is it, Tom?”
“Good old-fashioned salts. It may gripe you a little but it’ll do the job.”
She drank it obediently and made a face. “I remem-ber that taste,” she said. “Mother’s remedy in
green apple season.”
“Now you lie still,” Tom said. “I’ll rustle up some dinner.”
She could hear him knocking about in the kitchen. The pain roared through her body. And on top
of the pain there was fear. She could feel the medicine burn down to her stomach. After a while
she dragged herself to the new homemade flush toilet and tried to vomit the salts. The
perspiration ran from her forehead and blinded her. When she tried to straighten up the mus-cles
over her stomach were set, and she could not break free.
Later Tom brought her some scrambled eggs. She shook her head slowly. “I can’t,” she said,
smiling. “I think I’ll just go to bed.”
“The salts should work pretty soon,” Tom assured her. “Then you’ll be all right.” He helped her
to bed. “What do you suppose you ate to cause it?”
Dessie lay in her bedroom and her will battled the pain. About ten o’clock in the evening her will
began to lose its fight. She called, “Tom! Tom!” He opened the door. He had the World Almanac
in his hand. “Tom,” she said, “I’m sorry. But I’m awfully sick, Tom. I’m terribly sick.”
He sat on the edge of her bed in the half-darkness. “Are the gripes bad?”
“Yes, awful.”
“Can you go to the toilet now?”
“No, not now.”
“I’ll bring a lamp and sit with you,” he said. “Maybe you can get some sleep. It’ll be gone in the
morning. The salts will do the job.”
Her will took hold again and she lay still while Tom read bits out of the Almanac to soothe her.
He stopped reading when he thought she was sleeping, and he dozed in his chair beside the lamp.
A thin scream awakened him. He stepped beside the struggling bedclothes. Dessie’s eyes were
milky and cra-zy, like those of a maddened horse. Her mouth corners erupted thick bubbles and
her face was on fire. Tom put his hand under the cover and felt muscles knotted like iron. And
then her struggle stopped and her head fell back and the light glinted on her half-closed eyes.
Tom put only a bridle on the horse and flung himself on bareback. He groped and ripped out his
belt to beat the frightened horse to an awkward run over the stony, rutted wheel track.

The Duncans, asleep upstairs in their two-story house on the county road, didn’t hear the banging
on their door, but they heard the bang and ripping sound as their front door came off, carrying
lock and hinges with it. By the time Red Duncan got downstairs with a shotgun Tom was
screaming into the wall tele-phone at the King City central. “Dr. Tusón! Get him! I don’t care.
Get him! Get him, goddam it.” Red Duncan sleepily had the gun on him.
Dr. Tilson said, “Yes! Yes—yes, I hear. You’re Tom Hamilton. What’s the matter with her? Is
her stomach hard? What did you do? Salts! You goddam fool!”
Then the doctor controlled his anger. “Tom,” he said, “Tom, boy. Pull yourself together. Go back
and lay cold cloths—cold as you can get them. I don’t suppose you have any ice. Well, keep
changing the cloths. I’ll be out as fast as I can. Do you hear me? Tom, do you hear me?”
He hung the receiver up and dressed. In angry wea-riness he opened the wall cabinet and
collected scalpels and clamps, sponges and tubes and sutures, to put in his bag. He shook his
gasoline pressure lantern to make sure it was full and arranged ether can and mask beside it on his
bureau. His wife in boudoir cap and nightgown looked in. Dr. Tilson said, “I’m walking over to
the garage. Call Will Hamilton. Tell him I want him to drive me to his father’s place. If he argues
tell him his sister is—dying.”

3
Tom came riding back to the ranch a week after Dessie’s funeral, riding high and prim, his
shoulders straight and chin in, like a guardsman on parade. Tom had done everything slowly,
perfectly. His horse was curried and brushed, and his Stetson hat was square on his head. Not
even Samuel could have held himself in more dignity than Tom as he rode back to the old house.
A hawk driving down on a chicken with dou-bled fists did not make him turn his head.
At the barn he dismounted, watered his horse, held him a moment at the door, haltered him, and
put rolled barley in the box beside the manger. He took off the saddle and turned the blanket
inside out to dry. Then the barley was finished and he led the bay horse out and turned him free to
graze on every unfenced inch of the world.
In the house the furniture, chairs, and stove seemed to shrink back and away from him in distaste.
A stool avoided him as he went to the living room. His matches were soft and damp, and with a
feeling of apology he went to the kitchen for more. The lamp in the living room was fair and
lonely. Tom’s first match flame ran quickly around the Rochester wick and then stood up a full
inch of yellow flame.
Tom sat down in the evening and looked around. His eyes avoided the horsehair sofa. A slight
noise of mice in the kitchen made him turn, and he saw his shadow on the wall and his hat was
on. He removed it and laid it on the table beside him.
He thought dawdling, protective thoughts, sitting un-der the lamp, but he knew that pretty soon
his name would be called and he would have to go up before the bench with himself as judge and
his own crimes as jurors.
And his name was called, shrilly in his ears. His mind walked in to face the accusers: Vanity,
which charged him with being ill dressed and dirty and vul-gar; and Lust, slipping him the money

for his whoring; Dishonesty, to make him pretend to talent and thought he did not have; Laziness
and Gluttony arm in arm. Tom felt comforted by these because they screened the great Gray One
in the back seat, waiting—the gray and dreadful crime. He dredged up lesser things, used small
sins almost like virtues to save himself. There were Covetousness of Will’s money, Treason
toward his mother’s God, Theft of time and hope, sick Rejection of love.
Samuel spoke softly but his voice filled the room. “Be good, be pure, be great, be Tom Hamilton.”
Tom ignored his father. He said, “I’m busy greeting my friends,” and he nodded to Discourtesy
and Ugliness and Unfilial Conduct and Unkempt Finger-nails. Then he started with Vanity again.
The Gray One shouldered up in front. It was too late to stall with baby sins. This Gray One was
Murder.
Tom’s hand felt the chill of the glass and saw the pearly liquid with the dissolving crystals still
turning over and lucent bubbles rising, and he repeated aloud in the empty, empty room, “This
will do the job. Just wait till morning. You’ll feel fine then.” That’s how it had sounded, exactly
how, and the walls and chairs and the lamp had all heard it and they could prove it. There was no
place in the whole world for Tom Hamilton to live. But it wasn’t for lack of trying. He shuffled
possi-bilities like cards. London? No! Egypt—pyramids in Egypt and the Sphinx. No! Paris? No!
Now wait—they do all your sins lots better there. No! Well, stand aside and maybe we’ll come
back to you. Bethlehem? Dear God, no! It would be lonely there for a stranger.
And here interpolated—it’s so hard to remember how you die or when. An eyebrow raised or a
whisper—they may be it; or a night mottled with splashed light until powder-driven lead finds
your secret and lets out the fluid in you.
Now this is true, Tom Hamilton was dead and he had only to do a few decent things to make it
final.
The sofa cricked in criticism, and Tom looked at it and at the smoking lamp to which the sofa
referred. “Thank you,” Tom said to the sofa. “I hadn’t noticed it,” and he turned down the wick
until the smoking stopped.
His mind dozed. Murder slapped him aware again. Now Red Tom, Gum Tom, was too tired to
kill him-self. That takes some doing, with maybe pain and maybe hell.
He remembered that his mother had a strong distaste for suicide, feeling that it combined three
things of which she strongly disapproved—bad manners, cow-ardice, and sin. It was almost as
bad as adultery or stealing—maybe just as bad. There must be a way to avoid Liza’s disapproval.
She could make one suffer if she disapproved.
Samuel wouldn’t make it hard, but on the other hand you couldn’t avoid Samuel because he was
in the air every place. Tom had to tell Samuel. He said, “My father, I’m sorry. I can’t help it. You
overestimated me. You were wrong. I wish I could justify the love and the pride you squandered
on me. Maybe you could figure a way out, but I can’t. I cannot live. I’ve killed Dessie and I want
to sleep.”
And his mind spoke for his father absent, saying, “Why, I can understand how that would be.
There are so many patterns to choose from in the arc from birth back to birth again. But let’s
think how we can make it all right with Mother. Why are you so impatient, dear?”

“I can’t wait, that’s why,” Tom said. “I can’t wait any more.”
“Why, sure you can, my son, my darling. You’re grown great as I knew you would. Open the
table drawer and then make use of that turnip you call your head.”
Tom opened the drawer and saw a tablet of Crane’s Linen Lawn and a package of envelopes to
match and two gnawed and crippled pencils and in the dust corner at the back a few stamps. He
laid out the tablet and sharpened the pencils with his pocketknife.
He wrote, “Dear Mother, I hope you keep yourself well. I am going to plan to spend more time
with you. Olive asked me for Thanksgiving and you know I’ll be there. Our little Olive can cook
a turkey nearly to match yours, but I know you will never believe that. I’ve had a stroke of good
luck. Bought a horse for fifteen dollars—a gelding, and he looks like a blood-horse to me. I got
him cheap because he has taken a dislike to mankind. His former owner spent more time on his
own back than on the gelding’s. I must say he’s a pretty cute article. He’s thrown me twice but
I’ll get him yet, and if I break him I’ll have one of the best horses in the whole county. And you
can be sure I’ll break him if it takes all winter. I don’t know why I go on about him, only the man
I bought him from said a funny thing. He said, ‘That horse is so mean he’d eat a man right off his
back.’ Well, remember what Father used to say when we went rabbit hunting? ‘Come back with
your shield or on it.’ I’ll see you Thanksgiving. Your son Tom.”
He wondered whether it was good enough, but he was too tired to do it again. He added, “P.S. I
notice that Polly has not reformed one bit. That parrot makes me blush.”
On another sheet he wrote, “Dear Will, No matter what you yourself may think—please help me
now. For Mother’s sake—please. I was killed by a horse—thrown and kicked in the head—
please! Your brother Tom.”
He stamped the letters and put them in his pocket and he asked Samuel, “Is that all right?”
In his bedroom he broke open a new box of shells and put one of them in the cylinder of his welloiled Smith and Wesson .38 and he set the loaded chamber one space to the left of the firing pin.
His horse standing sleepily near the fence came to his whistle and stood drowsing while he
saddled up.
It was three o’clock in the morning when he dropped the letters in the post office at King City
and mounted and turned his horse south toward the unproductive hills of the old Hamilton place.
He was a gallant gentlemen.

PART FOUR

Chapter 34
A child may ask, “What is the world’s story about?” And a grown man or woman may wonder,
“What way will the world go? How does it end and, while we’re at it, what’s the story about?”
I believe that there is one story in the world, and only one, that has frightened and inspired us, so
that we live in a Pearl White serial of continuing thought and won-der. Humans are caught—in
their lives, in their thoughts, in their hungers and ambitions, in their ava-rice and cruelty, and in
their kindness and generosity too—in a net of good and evil. I think this is the only story we have
and that it occurs on all levels of feeling and intelligence. Virtue and vice were warp and woof of
our first consciousness, and they will be the fabric of our last, and this despite any changes we
may impose on field and river and mountain, on economy and man-ners. There is no other story.
A man, after he has brushed off the dust and chips of his life, will have left only the hard, clean
questions: Was it good or was it evil? Have I done well—or ill?
Herodotus, in the Persian War, tells a story of how Croesus, the richest and most-favored king of
his time, asked Solon the Athenian a leading question. He would not have asked it if he had not
been worried about the answer. “Who,” he asked, “is the luckiest person in the world?” He must
have been eaten with doubt and hungry for reassurance. Solon told him of three lucky people in
old times. And Croesus more than likely did not listen, so anxious was he about himself. And
when Solon did not mention him, Croesus was forced to say, “Do you not consider me lucky?”
Solon did not hesitate in his answer. “How can I tell?” he said. “You aren’t dead yet.”
And this answer must have haunted Croesus dismally as his luck disappeared, and his wealth and
his kingdom. And as he was being burned on a tall fire, he may have thought of it and perhaps
wished he had not asked or not been answered.
And in our time, when a man dies—if he has had wealth and influence and power and all the
vestments that arouse envy, and after the living take stock of the dead man’s property and his
eminence and works and monuments—the question is still there: Was his life good or was it evil?
—which is another way of putting Croesus’s question. Envies are gone, and the measuring stick
is: “Was he loved or was he hated? Is his death felt as a loss or does a kind of joy come of it?”
I remember clearly the deaths of three men. One was the richest man of the century, who, having
clawed his way to wealth through the souls and bodies of men, spent many years trying to buy
back the love he had forfeited and by that process performed great service to the world and,
perhaps, had much more than balanced the evils of his rise. I was on a ship when he died. The
news was posted on the bulletin board, and nearly everyone received the news with pleasure.
Several said, “Thank God that son of a bitch is dead.”
Then there was a man, smart as Satan, who, lacking some perception of human dignity and
knowing all too well every aspect of human weakness and wickedness, used his special
knowledge to warp men, to buy men, to bribe and threaten and seduce until he found himself in a

position of great power. He clothed his motives in the names of virtue, and I have wondered
whether he ever knew that no gift will ever buy back a man’s love when you have removed his
self-love. A bribed man can only hate his briber. When this man died the nation rang with praise
and, just beneath, with gladness that he was dead.
There was a third man, who perhaps made many errors in performance but whose effective life
was de-voted to making men brave and dignified and good in a time when they were poor and
frightened and when ugly forces were loose in the world to utilize their fears. This man was hated
by the few. When he died the people burst into tears in the streets and their minds wailed, “What
can we do now? How can we go on without him?”
In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good
and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love. When a man
comes to die, no matter what his talents and influence and genius, if he dies unloved his life must
be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror. It seems to me that if you or I must choose
between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that
our death brings no pleasure to the world.
We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves
of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue,
is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in
the world is.

Chapter 35
1
Lee helped Adam and the two boys move to Salinas, which is to say he did it all, packed the
things to be taken, saw them on the train, loaded the back seat of the Ford, and, arriving in
Salinas, unpacked and saw the family settled in Dessie’s little house. When he had done
everything he could think of to make them com-fortable, and a number of things unnecessary,
and more things for the sake of delay, he waited on Adam formally one evening after the twins
had gone to bed. Perhaps Adam caught his intention from Lee’s coldness and formality.
Adam said, “All right. I’ve been expecting it. Tell me.”
That broke up Lee’s memorized speech, which he had intended to begin, “For a number of years I
have served you to the best of my ability and now I feel—”
“I’ve put it off as long as I could,” said Lee. “I have a speech all ready. Do you want to hear it?”
“Do you want to say it?”
“No,” said Lee. “I don’t. And it’s a pretty good speech too.”
“When do you want to go?” Adam asked.
“As soon as possible. I’m afraid I might lose my intention if I don’t go soon. Do you want me to
wait until you get someone else?”
“Better not,” said Adam. “You know how slow I am. It might be some time. I might never get
around to it.”
“I’ll go tomorrow then.”
“It will tear the boys to pieces,” Adam said. “I don’t know what they’ll do. Maybe you’d better
sneak off and let me tell them afterward.”
“It’s my observation that children always surprise us,” said Lee.
And so it was. At breakfast the next morning Adam said, “Boys, Lee is going away.”
“Is he?” said Cal. “There’s a basketball game tonight, costs ten cents. Can we go?”
“Yes. But did you hear what I said?”
“Sure,” Aron said. “You said Lee’s going away.”
“But he’s not coming back.”
Cal asked, “Where’s he going?”
“To San Francisco to live.”
“Oh!” said Aron. “There’s a man on Main Street, right on the street, and he’s got a little stove and
he cooks sausages and puts them in buns. They cost a nickel. And you can take all the mustard
you want.”
Lee stood in the kitchen door, smiling at Adam.
When the twins got their books together Lee said, “Good-by, boys.”

They shouted, “Good-by!” and tumbled out of the house.
Adam stared into his coffee cup and said in apology, “What little brutes! I guess that’s your
reward for over ten years of service.”
“I like it better that way,” Lee said. “If they pre-tended sorrow they’d be liars. It doesn’t mean
anything to them. Maybe they’ll think of me sometimes—privately. I don’t want them to be sad. I
hope I’m not so small-souled as to take satisfaction in being missed.” He laid fifty cents on the
table in front of Adam. “When they start for the basketball game tonight, give them this from me
and tell them to buy the sausage buns. My farewell gift may be ptomaine, for all I know.”
Adam looked at the telescope basket Lee brought into the dining room. “Is that all your stuff,
Lee?”
“Everything but my books. They’re in boxes in the cellar. If you don’t mind I’ll send for them or
come for them after I get settled.”
“Why, sure. I’m going to miss you, Lee, whether you want me to or not. Are you really going to
get your bookstore?”
“That is my intention.”
“You’ll let us hear from you?”
“I don’t know. I’ll have to think about it. They say a clean cut heals soonest. There’s nothing
sadder to me than associations held together by nothing but the glue of postage stamps. If you
can’t see or hear or touch a man, it’s best to let him go.”
Adam stood up from the table. “I’ll walk to the depot with you.”
“No!” Lee said sharply. “No. I don’t want that. Good-by, Mr. Trask. Good-by, Adam.” He went
out of the house so fast that Adam’s “Good-by” reached him at the bottom of the front steps and
Adam’s “Don’t for-get to write” sounded over the click of the front gate.

2
That night after the basketball game Cal and Aron each had five sausages on buns, and it was just
as well, for Adam had forgotten to provide any supper. Walking home, the twins discussed Lee
for the first time.
“I wonder why he went away?” Cal asked.
“He’s talked about going before.”
“What do you suppose he’ll do without us?”
“I don’t know. I bet he comes back,” Aron said.
“How do you mean? Father said he was going to start a bookstore. That’s funny. A Chinese
bookstore.”
“He’ll come back,” said Aron. “He’ll get lonesome for us. You’ll see.”
“Bet you ten cents he don’t.”
“Before when?”
“Before forever.”
“That’s a bet,” said Aron.
Aron was not able to collect his winnings for nearly a month, but he won six days later.

Lee came in on the ten-forty and let himself in with his own key. There was a light in the dining
room but Lee found Adam in the kitchen, scraping at a thick black crust in the frying pan with the
point of a can opener.
Lee put down his basket. “If you soak it overnight it will come right out.”
“Will it? I’ve burned everything I’ve cooked. There’s a saucepan of beets out in the yard.
Smelled so bad I couldn’t have them in the house. Burned beets are awful—“Lee!” he cried, and
then. “Is anything the matter?”
Lee took the black iron pan from him and put it in the sink and ran water in it. “If we had a new
gas stove we could make a cup of coffee in a few minutes,” he said. “I might as well build up the
fire.”
“Stove won’t burn,” said Adam.
Lee lifted a lid. “Have you ever taken the ashes out?”
“Ashes?”
“Oh, go in the other room,” said Lee. “I’ll make some coffee.”
Adam waited impatiently in the dining room but he obeyed his orders. At last Lee brought in two
cups of coffee and set them on the table. “Made it in a skillet,” he said. “Much faster.” He leaned
over his telescope basket and untied the rope that held it shut. He brought out the stone bottle.
“Chinese absinthe,” he said. “Ng-ka-py maybe last ten more years. I forgot to ask whether you
had replaced me.”
“You’re beating around the bush,” said Adam.
“I know it. And I also know the best way would be just to tell it and get it over with.”
“You lost your money in a fan-tan game.”
“No. I wish that was it. No, I have my money. This damn cork’s broken—I’ll have to shove it in
the bot-tle.” He poured the black liquor into his coffee. “I never drank it this way,” he said. “Say,
it’s good.”
“Tastes like rotten apples,” said Adam.
“Yes, but remember Sam Hamilton said like good rotten apples.”
Adam said, “When do you think you’ll get around to telling me what happened to you?”
“Nothing happened to me,” said Lee. “I got lonesome. That’s all. Isn’t that enough?”
“How about your bookstore?”
“I don’t want a bookstore. I think I knew it before I got on the train, but I took all this time to
make sure.”
“Then there’s your last dream gone.”
“Good riddance.” Lee seemed on the verge of hyste-ria. “Missy Tlask, Chinee boy sink gung get
dlunk.”
Adam was alarmed. “What’s the matter with you anyway?”
Lee lifted the bottle to his lips and took a deep hot drink and panted the fumes out of his burning
throat. “Adam,” he said, “I am incomparably, incredibly, overwhelmingly glad to be home. I’ve
never been so goddam lonesome in my life.”

Chapter 36
1
Salinas had two grammar schools, big yellow structures with tall windows, and the windows
were baleful and the doors did not smile. These schools were called the East End and the West
End. Since the East End School was way to hell and gone across town and the children who lived
east of Main Street attended there, I will not bother with it.
The West End, a huge building of two stories, fronted with gnarled poplars, divided the play
yards called girlside and boyside. Behind the school a high board fence separated girlside from
boyside, and the back of the play yard was bounded by a slough of standing water in which tall
tules and even cattails grew. The West End had grades from third to eighth. The first- and secondgraders went to Baby School some distance away.
In the West End there was a room for each grade—third, four, and fifth on the ground floor, six,
seventh, and eighth on the second floor. Each room had the usual desks of battered oak, a
platform and square teacher’s desk, one Seth Thomas clock and one pic-ture. The pictures
identified the rooms, and the pre-Raphaelite influence was overwhelming. Galahad standing in
full armor pointed the way for third-grad-ers; Atalanta’s race urged on the fourth, the Pot of Basil
confused the fifth grade, and so on until the denuncia-tion of Cataline sent the eighth-graders on
to high school with a sense of high civic virtue.
Cal and Aron were assigned to the seventh grade because of their age, and they learned every
shadow of its picture—Laocoön completely wrapped in snakes.
The boys were stunned by the size and grandeur of the West End after their background in a oneroom country school. The opulence of having a teacher for each grade made a deep impression on
them. It seemed wasteful. But as is true of all humans, they were stunned for one day, admiring
on the second, and on the third day could not remember very clearly ever having gone to any
other school.
The teacher was dark and pretty, and by a judicious raising or withholding of hands the twins had
no wor-ries. Cal worked it out quickly and explained it to Aron. “You take most kids,” he said,
“if they know the answer, why, they hold up their hands, and if they don’t know they just crawl
under the desk. Know what we’re going to do?”
“No. What?”
“Well, you notice the teacher don’t always call on somebody with his hand up. She lets drive at
the others and, sure enough, they don’t know.”
“That’s right,” said Aron.
“Now, first week we’re going to work like bedamned but we won’t stick up our hands. So she’ll
call on us and we’ll know. That’ll throw her. So the second week we won’t work and we’ll stick

up our hands and she won’t call on us. Third week we’ll just sit quiet, and she won’t ever know
whether we got the answer or not. Pretty soon she’ll let us alone. She isn’t going to waste her
time calling on somebody that knows.”
Cal’s method worked. In a short time the twins were not only let alone but got themselves a
certain reputa-tion for smartness. As a matter of fact, Cal’s method was a waste of time. Both
boys learned easily enough.
Cal was able to develop his marble game and set about gathering in all the chalkies and immies,
glassies and agates, in the schoolyard. He traded them for tops just as marble season ended. At
one time he had and used as legal tender at least forty-five tops of various sizes and colors, from
the thick clumsy baby tops to the lean and dangerous splitters with their needle points.
Everyone who saw the twins remarked on their dif-ference one from the other and seemed
puzzled that this should be so. Cal was growing up dark-skinned, dark-haired. He was quick and
sure and secret. Even though he may have tried, he could not conceal his cleverness. Adults were
impressed with what seemed to them a precocious maturity, and they were a little frightened at it
too. No one liked Cal very much and yet everyone was touched with fear of him and through fear
with respect. Although he had no friends he was welcomed by his obsequious classmates and
took up a natural and cold position of leadership in the schoolyard.
If he concealed his ingenuity, he concealed his hurts too. He was regarded as thick-skinned and
insensitive—even cruel.
Aron drew love from every side. He seemed shy and delicate. His pink-and-white skin, golden
hair, and wide-set blue eyes caught attention. In the schoolyard his very prettiness caused some
difficulty until it was discovered by his testers that Aron was a dogged, steady, and completely
fearless fighter, particularly when he was crying. Word got around, and the natural punishers of
new boys learned to let him alone. Aron did not attempt to hide his disposition. It was con-cealed
by being the opposite of his appearance. He was unchanging once a course was set. He had few
facets and very little versatility. His body was as in-sensitive to pain as was his mind to subtleties.
Cal knew his brother and could handle him by keep-ing him off balance, but this only worked up
to a certain point. Cal had learned when to sidestep, when to run away. Change of direction
confused Aron, but that was the only thing that confused him. He set his path and followed it and
he did not see nor was he interested in anything beside his path. His emotions were few and
heavy. All of him was hidden by his angelic face, and for this he had no more concern or
responsibility than has a fawn for the dappling spots on its young hide.

2
On Aron’s first day in school he waited eagerly for the recess. He went over to the girlside to talk
to Abra. A mob of squealing girls could not drive him out. It took a full-grown teacher to force
him back to the boyside.
At noon he missed her, for her father came by in his high-wheeled buggy and drove her home for
her lunch. He waited outside the schoolyard gate for her after school.
She came out surrounded by girls. Her face was composed and gave no sign that she expected

him. She was far the prettiest girl in the school, but it is doubtful whether Aron had noticed that.
The cloud of girls hung on and hung on. Aron marched along three paces behind them, patient
and unembarrassed even when the girls tossed their squeal-ing barbs of insult over their shoulders
at him. Gradually some drifted away to their own homes, and only three girls were with Abra
when she came to the white gate of her yard and turned in. Her friends stared at him a moment,
giggled, and went on their way.
Aron sat down on the edge of the sidewalk. After a moment the latch lifted, the white gate
opened, and Abra emerged. She walked across the walk and stood over him. “What do you want?”
Aron’s wide eyes looked up at her. “You aren’t engaged to anybody?”
“Silly,” she said.
He struggled up to his feet. “I guess it will be a long time before we can get married,” he said.
“Who wants to get married?”
Aron didn’t answer. Perhaps he didn’t hear. He walked along beside her.
Abra moved with firm and deliberate steps and she faced straight ahead. There was wisdom and
sweetness in her expression. She seemed deep in thought. And Aron, walking beside her, never
took his eyes from her face. His attention seemed tied to her face by a taut string.
They walked silently past the Baby School, and there the pavement ended. Abra turned right and
led the way through the stubble of the summer’s hayfield. The black ’dobe clods crushed under
their feet.
On the edge of the field stood a little pump house, and a willow tree flourished beside it, fed by
the over-spill of water. The long skirts of the willow hung down nearly to the ground.
Abra parted the switches like a curtain and went into the house of leaves made against the willow
trunk by the sweeping branches. You could see out through the leaves, but inside it was sweetly
protected and warm and safe. The afternoon sunlight came yellow through the aging leaves.
Abra sat down on the ground, or rather she seemed to drift down, and her full skirts settled in a
billow around her. She folded her hands in her lap almost as though she were praying.
Aron sat down beside her. “I guess it will be a long time before we can get married,” he said
again. “Not so long,” Abra said. “I wish it was now.”
“It won’t be so long,” said Abra. Aron asked, “Do you think your father will let you?”
It was a new thought to her, and she turned and looked at him. “Maybe I won’t ask him.”
“But your mother?”
“Let’s not disturb them,” she said. “They’d think it was funny or bad. Can’t you keep a secret?”
“Oh, yes. I can keep secrets better than anybody. And I’ve got some too.”
Abra said, “Well, you just put this one with the others.”
Aron picked up a twig and drew a line on the dark earth. “Abra, do you know how you get
babies?”
“Yes,” she said. “Who told you?”
“Lee told me. He explained the whole thing. I guess we can’t have any babies for a long time.”
Abra’s mouth turned up at the corners with a con-descending wisdom. “Not so long,” she said.
“We’ll have a house together some time,” Aron said, bemused. “We’ll go in and close the door

and it will be nice. But that will be a long time.”
Abra put out her hand and touched him on the arm. “Don’t you worry about long times,” she said.
“This is a kind of a house. We can play like we live here while we’re waiting. And you will be
my husband and you can call me wife.”
He tried it over under his breath and then aloud. “Wife,” he said. “It’ll be like practicing,” said
Abra.
Aron’s arm shook under her hand, and she put it, palm up, in her lap.
Aron said suddenly, “While we’re practicing, maybe we could do something else.”
“What?”
“Maybe you wouldn’t like it.”
“What is it?”
“Maybe we could pretend like you’re my mother.”
“That’s easy,” she said.
“Would you mind?”
“No, I’d like it. Do you want to start now?”
“Sure,” Aron said. “How do you want to go about it?”
“Oh, I can tell you that,” said Abra. She put a cooing tone in her voice and said, “Come, my baby,
put your head in Mother’s lap. Come, my little son. Mother will hold you.” She drew his head
down, and without warning Aron began to cry and could not stop. He wept quietly, and Abra
stroked his cheek and wiped the flowing tears away with the edge of her skirt.
The sun crept down toward its setting place behind the Salinas River, and a bird began to sing
wonderfully from the golden stubble of the field. It was as beautiful under the branches of the
willow tree as anything in the world can be.
Very slowly Aron’s weeping stopped, and he felt good and he felt warm.
“My good little baby,” Abra said. “Here, let Mother brush your hair back.”
Aron sat up and said almost angrily, “I don’t hardly ever cry unless I’m mad. I don’t know why I
cried.”
Abra asked, “Do you remember your mother?”
“No. She died when I was a little bit of a baby.”
“Don’t you know what she looked like?”
“No.”
“Maybe you saw a picture.”
“No, I tell you. We don’t have any pictures. I asked Lee and he said no pictures—no, I guess it
was Cal asked Lee.”
“When did she die?”
“Right after Cal and I were born.”
“What was her name?”
“Lee says it was Cathy. Say, what you asking so much for?”
Abra went on calmly, “How was she complected?”
“What?”

“Light or dark hair?”
“I don’t know.”
“Didn’t your father tell you?”
“We never asked him.”
Abra was silent, and after a while Aron asked, “What’s the matter—cat got your tongue?”
Abra inspected the setting sun.
Aron asked uneasily, “You mad with me”—and he added tentatively—“wife?”
“No, I’m not mad. I’m just wondering.”
“What about?”
“About something.” Abra’s firm face was tight against a seething inner argument. She asked,
“What’s it like not to have any mother?”
“I don’t know. It’s like anything else.”
“I guess you wouldn’t even know the difference.”
“I would too. I wish you would talk out. You’re like riddles in the Bulletin.”
Abra continued in her concentrated imperturbability, “Do you want to have a mother?”
“That’s crazy,” said Aron. “ ’Course I do. Everybody does. You aren’t trying to hurt my feelings,
are you? Cal tries that sometimes and then he laughs.”
Abra looked away from the setting sun. She had difficulty seeing past the purple spots the light
had left on her eyes. “You said a little while ago you could keep secrets.”
“I can.”
“Well, do you have a double-poison-and-cut-my-throat secret?”
“Sure I have.”
Abra said softly, “Tell me what it is, Aron.” She put a caress in his name.
“Tell you what?”
“Tell me the deepest down hell-and-goddam secret you know.”
Aron reared back from her in alarm. “Why, I will not,” he said. “What right you got to ask me? I
wouldn’t tell anybody.”
“Come on, my baby—tell Mother,” she crooned.
There were tears crowding up in his eyes again, but this time they were tears of anger. “I don’t
know as I want to marry you,” he said. “I think I’m going home now.”
Abra put her hand on his wrist and hung on. Her voice lost its coquetry. “I wanted to see. I guess
you can keep secrets all right.”
“Why did you go for to do it? I’m mad now. I feel sick.”
“I think I’m going to tell you a secret,” she said.
“Ho!” he jeered at her. “Who can’t keep a secret now?”
“I was trying to decide,” she said. “I think I’m going to tell you this secret because it might be
good for you. It might make you glad.”
“Who told you not to tell?”
“Nobody,” she said. “I only told myself.”
“Well, I guess that’s a little different. What’s your old secret?”

The red sun leaned its rim on the rooftree of Tollot’s house on the Blanco Road, and Tollot’s
chimney stuck up like a black thumb against it.
Abra said softly, “Listen, you remember when we came to your place that time?”
“Sure!”
“Well, in the buggy I went to sleep, and when I woke up my father and mother didn’t know I was
awake. They said your mother wasn’t dead. They said she went away. They said something bad
must have happened to her, and she went away.”
Aron said hoarsely, “She’s dead.”
“Wouldn’t it be nice if she wasn’t?”
“My father says she’s dead. He’s not a liar.”
“Maybe he thinks she’s dead.
He said, “I think he’d know.” But there was uncer-tainty in his tone.
Abra said, “Wouldn’t it be nice if we could find her? ’Spose she lost her memory or something.
I’ve read about that. And we could find her and that would make her remember.” The glory of the
romance caught her like a rip tide and carried her away.
Aron said, “I’ll ask my father.”
“Aron,” she said sternly, “what I told you is a secret.”
“Who says?”
“I say. Now you just say after me—‘I’ll take double poison and cut my throat if I tell.’ ”
For a moment he hesitated and then he repeated, “I’ll take double poison and cut my throat if I
tell.”
She said, “Now spit in your palm—like this—that’s right. Now you give me your hand—see?—
squidge the spit all together. Now rub it dry on your hair.” The two followed the formula, and
then Abra said solemnly, “Now, I’d just like to see you tell that one. I knew one girl that told a
secret after that oath and she burned up in a barn fire.”
The sun was gone behind Toiler’s house and the gold light with it. The evening star shimmered
over Mount Toro.
Abra said, “They’ll skin me alive. Come on. Hurry! I bet my father’s got the dog whistle out for
me. I’ll get whipped.”
Aron looked at her in disbelief. “Whipped! They don’t whip you?”
“That’s what you think!”
Aron said passionately, “You just let them try. If they go for to whip you, you tell them I’ll kill
them.” His wide-set blue eyes were slitted and glinting. “No-body’s going to whip my wife,” he
said.
Abra put her arms around his neck in the dusk under the willow tree. She kissed him on his open
mouth. “I love you, husband,” she said, and then she turned and bolted, holding up her skirts
above her knees, her lace-edged white drawers flashing as she ran toward home.

Aron went back to the trunk of the willow tree and sat on the ground and leaned back against the

bark. His mind was a grayness and there were churnings of pain in his stomach. He tried to sort
out the feeling into thoughts and pictures so the pain would go away. It was hard. His slow
deliberate mind could not accept so many thoughts and emotions at once. The door was shut
against everything except physical pain. After a while the door opened a little and let in one thing
to be scrutinized and then another and another, until all had been absorbed, one at a time. Outside
his closed mind a huge thing was clamoring to get in. Aron held it back until last.
First he let Abra in and went over her dress, her face, the feel of her hand on his cheek, the odor
that came from her, like milk a little and like cut grass a little. He saw and felt and heard and
smelled her all over again. He thought how clean she was, her hands and fingernails, and how
straightforward and unlike the gigglers in the schoolyard.
Then, in order, he thought of her holding his head and his baby crying, crying with longing,
wanting some-thing and in a way feeling that he was getting it. Per-haps the getting it was what
had made him cry.
Next he thought of her trick—her testing of him. He wondered what she would have done if he
had told her a secret. What secret could he have told her if he had wished? Right now- he didn’t
recall any secret except the one that was beating on the door to get into his mind.
The sharpest question she had asked, “How does it feel not to have a mother?” slipped into his
mind. And how did it feel? It didn’t feel like anything. Ah, but in the schoolroom, at Christmas
and graduation, when the mothers of other children came to the parties—then was the silent cry
and the wordless longing. That’s what it was like.
Salinas was surrounded and penetrated with swamps, with tule-filled ponds, and every pond
spawned thou-sands of frogs. With the evening the air was so full of their song that it was a kind
of roaring silence. It was a veil, a background, and its sudden disappearance, as after a clap of
thunder, was a shocking thing. It is possible that if in the night the frog sound should have
stopped, everyone in Salinas would have awakened, feeling that there was a great noise. In their
millions the frog songs seemed to have a beat and a cadence, and perhaps it is the ears’ function
to do this just as it is the eyes’ business to make stars twinkle.
It was quite dark under the willow tree now. Aron wondered whether he was ready for the big
thing, and while he wondered it slipped through and was in.
His mother was alive. Often he had pictured her lying underground, still and cool and unrotted.
But this was not so. Somewhere she moved about and spoke, and her hands moved and her eyes
were open. And in the midst of his flood of pleasure a sorrow came down on him and a sense of
loss, of dreadful loss. Aron was puzzled. He inspected the cloud of sadness. If his mother was
alive, his father was a liar. If one was alive, the other was dead. Aron said aloud under the tree,
“My mother is dead. She’s buried some place in the East.”
In the darkness he saw Lee’s face and heard Lee’s soft speech. Lee had built very well. Having a
respect that amounted to reverence for the truth, he had also its natural opposite, a loathing of a
lie. He had made it very clear to the boys exactly what he meant. If something was untrue and
you didn’t know it, that was error. But if you knew a true thing and changed it to a false thing,
both you and it were loathsome.

Lee’s voice said, “I know that sometimes a lie is used in kindness. I don’t believe it ever works
kindly. The quick pain of truth can pass away, but the slow, eating agony of a lie is never lost.
That’s a running sore.” And Lee had worked patiently and slowly and he had suc-ceeded in
building Adam as the center, the foundation, the essence of truth.
Aron shook his head in the dark, shook it hard in disbelief. “If my father is a liar, Lee is a liar
too.” He was lost. He had no one to ask. Cal was a liar, but Lee’s conviction had made Cal a
clever liar. Aron felt that something had to die—his mother or his world.
His solution lay suddenly before him. Abra had not lied. She had told him only what she had
heard, and her parents had only heard it too. He got to his feet and pushed his mother back into
death and closed his mind against her.
He was late for supper. “I was with Abra,” he explained. After supper, when Adam sat in his new
comfortable chair, reading the Salinas Index, he felt a stroking touch on his shoulder and looked
up. “What is it, Aron?” he asked.
“Good night, Father,” Aron said.

Chapter 37
1
February in Salinas is likely to be damp and cold and full of miseries. The heaviest rains fall then,
and if the river is going to rise, it rises then. February of 1915 was a year heavy with water.
The Trasks were well established in Salinas. Lee, once he had given up his brackish bookish
dream, made a new kind of place for himself in the house beside Reynaud’s Bakery. On the ranch
his possessions had never really been unpacked, for Lee had lived poised to go someplace else.
Here, for the first time in his life, he built a home for himself, feathered with comfort and
permanence.
The large bedroom nearest the street door fell to him. Lee dipped into his savings. He had never
before spent a needless penny, since all money had been ear-marked for his bookstore. But now
he bought a little hard bed and a desk. He built bookshelves and un-packed his books, invested in
a soft rug and tacked prints on the walls. He placed a deep and comfortable “Morris chair under
the best reading lamp he could find. And last he bought a typewriter and set about learning to use
it.
Having broken out of his own Spartanism, he re-made the Trask household, and Adam gave him
no opposition. A gas stove came into the house and electric wires and a telephone. He spent
Adam’s money re-morselessly—new furniture, new carpets, a gas water-heater, and a large
icebox. In a short time there was hardly a house in Salinas so well equipped. Lee defend-ed
himself to Adam, saying, “You have plenty of mon-ey. It would be a shame not to enjoy it.”
“I’m not complaining,” Adam protested. “Only I’d like to buy something too. What shall I buy?”
“Why don’t you go to Logan’s music store and listen to one of the new phonographs?”
“I think I’ll do that,” said Adam. And he bought a Victor victrola, a tall Gothic instrument, and he
went regularly to see what new records had come in.
The growing century was shucking Adam out of his shell. He subscribed to the Atlantic Monthly
and the National Geographic. He joined the Masons and seri-ously considered the Elks. The new
icebox fascinated him. He bought a textbook on refrigeration and began to study it.
The truth was that Adam needed work. He came out of his long sleep needing to do something.
“I think I’ll go into business,” he said to Lee.
“You don’t need to. You have enough to live on.”
“But I’d like to be doing something.”
“That’s different,” said Lee. “Know what you want to do? I don’t think you’d be very good at
business.”
“Why not?”
“Just a thought,” said Lee.

“Say, Lee, I want you to read an article. It says they’ve dug up a mastodon in Siberia. Been in the
ice thousands of years. And the meat’s still good.”
Lee smiled at him. “You’ve got a bug in your bonnet somewhere,” he said. “What have you got
in all of those little cups in the icebox?”
“Different things.”
“Is that the business? Some of the cups smell bad.”
“It’s an idea,” Adam said. “I can’t seem to stay away from it. I just can’t seem to get over the idea
that you can keep things if you get them cold enough.”
“Let’s not have any mastodon meat in our icebox,” said Lee.
If Adam had conceived thousands of ideas, the way Sam Hamilton had, they might all have
drifted away, but he had only the one. The frozen mastodon stayed in his mind. His little cups of
fruit, of pudding, of bits of meat, both cooked and raw, continued in the icebox. He bought every
available book on bacteria and began sending for magazines that printed articles of a mildly
scientific nature. And as is usually true of a man of one idea, he became obsessed.
Salinas had a small ice company, not large but enough to supply the few houses with iceboxes
and to service the ice-cream parlors. The horse-drawn ice wag-on went its route every day.
Adam began to visit the ice plant, and pretty soon he was taking his little cups to the freezing
chambers. He wished with all his heart that Sam Hamilton were alive to discuss cold with him.
Sam would have covered the field very quickly, he thought.
Adam was walking back from the ice plant one rainy afternoon, thinking about Sam Hamilton,
when he saw Will Hamilton go into the Abbot House Bar. He fol-lowed him and leaned against
the bar beside him. “Why don’t you come up and have some supper with us?”
“I’d like to,” Will said. “I’ll tell you what—I’ve got a deal I’m trying to put through. If I get
finished in time I’ll walk by. Is there something important?”
“Well, I don’t know. I’ve been doing some thinking and I’d like to ask your advice.”
Nearly every business proposition in the county came sooner or later to Will Hamilton’s
attention. He might have excused himself if he had not remembered that Adam was a rich man.
An idea was one thing, but backed up with cash it was quite another. “You wouldn’t entertain a
reasonable offer for your ranch, would you?” he asked.
“Well, the boys, particularly Cal, they like the place. I think I’ll hang on to it.”
“I think I can turn it over for you.”
“No, it’s rented, paying its own taxes. I’ll hold on to it.”
“If I can’t get in for supper I might be able to come in afterward,” said Will.
Will Hamilton was a very substantial businessman. No one knew exactly how many pies his
thumb had explored, but it was known that he was a clever and comparatively rich man. His
business deal had been non-existent. It was a part of his policy always to be busy and occupied.
He had supper alone in the Abbot House. After a considered time he walked around the corner on
Central Avenue and rang the bell of Adam Trask’s house.
The boys had gone to bed. Lee sat with a darning basket, mending the long black stockings the
twins wore to school. Adam had been reading the Scientific American. He let Will in and placed a

chair for him. Lee brought a pot of coffee and went back to his mending.
Will settled himself into a chair, took out a fat black cigar, and lighted up. He waited for Adam to
open the game.
“Nice weather for a change. And how’s your moth-er?” Adam said.
“Just fine. Seems younger every day. The boys must be growing up.”
“Oh, they are. Cal’s going to be in his school play. He’s quite an actor. Aron’s a real good
student. Cal wants to go to farming.”
“Nothing wrong with that if you go about it right. Country could use some forward-looking
farmers.” Will waited uneasily. He wondered if it could be that Adam’s money was exaggerated.
Could Adam be get-ting ready to borrow money? Will quickly worked out how much he would
lend on the Trask ranch and how much he could borrow on it. The figures were not the same, nor
was the interest rate. And still Adam did not come up with his proposition. Will grew restless. “I
can’t stay very long,” he said. “Told a fellow I’d meet him later tonight.”
“Have another cup of coffee,” Adam suggested.
“No, thanks. Keeps me awake. Did you have some-thing you wanted to see me about?”
Adam said, “I was thinking about your father and I thought I’d like to talk to a Hamilton.”
Will relaxed a little in his chair. “He was a great old talker.”
“Somehow he made a man better than he was,” said Adam.
Lee looked up from his darning egg. “Perhaps the best conversationalist in the world is the man
who helps others to talk.”
Will said, “You know, it sounds funny to hear you use all those two-bit words. I’d swear to God
you used to talk pidgin.”
“I used to,” said Lee. “It was vanity, I guess.” He smiled at Adam and said to Will, “Did you hear
that somewhere up in Siberia they dug a mastodon out of the ice? It had been there a hundred
thousand years and the meat was still fresh.”
“Mastodon?”
“Yes, a kind of elephant that hasn’t lived on the earth for a long time.”
“Meat was still fresh?”
“Sweet as a pork chop,” said Lee. He shoved the wooden egg into the shattered-knee of a black
stocking.
“That’s very interesting,” said Will.
Adam laughed. “Lee hasn’t wiped my nose yet, but that will come,” he said. “I guess I’m pretty
round-about. The whole thing comes up because I’m tired of just sitting around. I want to get
something to take up my time.”
“Why don’t you farm your place?”
“No. That doesn’t interest me. You see, Will, I’m not like a man looking for a job. I’m looking
for work. I don’t need a job.”
Will came out of his cautiousness. “Well, what can I do for you?”
“I thought I’d tell you an idea I had, and you might give me an opinion. You’re a businessman.”
“Of course,” said Will. “Anything I can do.”

“I’ve been looking into refrigeration,” said Adam. “I got an idea and I can’t get rid of it. I go to
sleep and it comes right back at me. Never had anything give me so much trouble. It’s a kind of a
big idea. Maybe it’s full of holes.”
Will uncrossed his legs and pulled at his pants where they were binding him. “Go ahead—shoot,”
he said. “Like a cigar?”
Adam didn’t hear the offer, nor did he know the implication. “The whole country’s changing,”
Adam said. “People aren’t going to live the way they used to. Do you know where the biggest
market for oranges in the winter is?”
“No. Where?”
“New York City. I read that. Now in the cold parts of the country, don’t you think people get to
wanting perishable things in the winter—like peas and lettuce and cauliflower? In a big part of
the country they don’t have those things for months and months. And right here in the Salinas
Valley we can raise them all the year around.”
“Right here isn’t right there,” said Will. “What’s your idea?”
“Well, Lee made me get a big icebox, and I got kind of interested. I put different kinds of
vegetables in there. And I got to arranging them different ways. You know, Will, if you chop ice
fine and lay a head of lettuce in it and wrap it in waxed paper, it will keep three weeks and come
out fresh and good.”
“Go on,” said Will cautiously.
“Well, you know the railroads built those fruit cars. I went down and had a look at them. They’re
pretty good. Do you know we could ship lettuce right to the east coast in the middle of winter?”
Will asked, “Where do you come in?”
“I was thinking of buying the ice plant here in Salinas and trying to ship some things.”
“That would cost a lot of money.”
“I have quite a lot of money,” said Adam.
Will Hamilton putted his lip angrily. “I don’t know why I got into this,” he said. “I know better.”
“How do you mean?”
“Look here,” said Will. “When a man comes to me for advice about an idea, I know he doesn’t
want advice. He wants me to agree with him. And if I want to keep his friendship I tell him his
idea is fine and go ahead. But I like you and you’re a friend of my family, so I’m going to stick
my neck out.”
Lee put down his darning, moved his sewing basket to the floor, and changed his glasses.
Adam remonstrated, “What are you getting upset about?”
“I come from a whole goddam family of inventors,” said Will. “We had ideas for breakfast. We
had ideas instead of breakfast. We had so many ideas we forgot to make the money for groceries.
When we got a little ahead my father, or Tom, patented something. I’m the only one in the
family, except my mother, who didn’t have ideas, and I’m the only one who ever made a dime.
Tom had ideas about helping people, and some of it was pretty darn near socialism. And if you
tell me you don’t care about making a profit, I’m going to throw that coffee pot right at your
head.”

“Well, I don’t care much.”
“You stop right there, Adam. I’ve got my neck out. If you want to drop forty or fifty thousand
dollars quick, you just go on with your idea. But I’m telling you—let your damned idea die. Kick
dust over it.”
“What’s wrong with it?”
“Everything’s wrong with it. People in the East aren’t used to vegetables in the winter. They
wouldn’t buy them. You get your cars stuck on a siding and you’ll lose the shipment. The market
is controlled. Oh, Jesus Christ! It makes me mad when babies try to ride into business on an idea.”
Adam sighed. “You make Sam Hamilton sound like a criminal,” he said.
“Well, he was my father and I loved him, but I wish to God he had let ideas alone.” Will looked
at Adam and saw amazement in his eyes, and suddenly Will was ashamed. He shook his head
slowly from side to side. “I didn’t mean to run down my people,” he said. “I think they were
good people. But my advice to you stands. Let refrigeration alone.”
Adam turned slowly to Lee. “Have we got any more of that lemon pie we had for supper?” he
asked.
“I don’t think so,” said Lee. “I thought I heard mice in the kitchen. I’m afraid there will be white
of egg on the boys’ pillows. You’ve got half a quart of whisky.”
“Have I? Why don’t we have that?”
“I got excited,” said Will, and he tried to laugh at himself. “A drink would do me good.” His face
was fiery red and his voice was strained in his throat. “I’m getting too fat,” he said.
But he had two drinks and relaxed. Sitting com-fortably, he instructed Adam. “Some things don’t
ever change their value,” he said. “If you want to put money into something, you look around at
the world. This war in Europe is going to go on a long time. And when there’s war there’s going
to be hungry people. I won’t say it is so, but it wouldn’t surprise me if we got into it. I don’t trust
this Wilson—he’s all theory and big words. And if we do get into it, there’s going to be fortunes
made in imperishable foods. You take rice and corn and wheat and beans, they don’t need ice.
They keep, and people can stay alive on them. I’d say if you were to plant your whole damned
bottom land to beans and just put them away, why, your boys wouldn’t have to worry about the
future. Beans are up to three cents now. If we get into the war I wouldn’t be surprised if they
went to ten cents. And you keep beans dry and they’ll be right there, waiting for a market. If you
want to turn a profit, you plant beans.”
He went away feeling good. The shame that had come over him was gone and he knew he had
given sound advice.
After Will had gone Lee brought out one-third of a lemon pie and cut it in two. ‘“He’s getting too
fat,” Lee said.
Adam was thinking. “I only said I wanted something to do,” he observed.
“How about the ice-plant?”
“I think I’ll buy it.”
“You might plant some beans too,” said Lee.

Late in the year Adam made his great try, and it was a sensation in a year of sensations, both local
and interna-tional. As he got ready, businessmen spoke of him as farseeing, forward-looking,
progress-minded. The de-parture of six carloads of lettuce packed in ice was given a civic
overtone. The Chamber of Commerce attended the departure. The cars were decorated with big
posters which said, “Salinas Valley Lettuce.” But no one wanted to invest in the project.
Adam untapped energy he did not suspect he had. It was a big job to gather, trim, box, ice, and
load the lettuce. There was no equipment for such work. Every-thing had to be improvised, a
great many hands hired and taught to do the work. Everyone gave advice but no one helped. It
was estimated that Adam had spent a fortune on his idea, but how big a fortune no one knew.
Adam did not know. Only Lee knew.
The idea looked good. The lettuce was consigned to commission merchants in New York at a fine
price. Then the train was gone and everyone went home to wait. If it was a success any number of
men were willing to dig down to put money in. Even Will Hamil-ton wondered whether he had
not been wrong with his advice.
If the series of events had been planned by an om-nipotent and unforgiving enemy it could not
have been more effective. As the train came to Sacramento a snow slide closed the Sierras for
two days and the six cars stood on a siding, dripping their ice away. On the third day the freight
crossed the mountains, and that was the time for unseasonable warm weather throughout the
Middle West. In Chicago there developed a confusion of orders—no one’s fault—just one of
those things that happen, and Adam’s six cars of lettuce stood in the yard for five more days. That
was enough, and there is no reason to go into it in detail. What arrived in New York was six
carloads of horrible slop with a sizable charge just to get rid of it.
Adam read the telegram from the commission house and he settled back in his chair and a strange
enduring smile came on his face and did not go away.
Lee kept away from him to let him get a grip on himself. The boys heard the reaction in Salinas.
Adam was a fool. These know-it-all dreamers always got into trouble. Businessmen congratulated
themselves on their foresight in keeping out of it. It took experience to be a businessman. People
who inherited their money always got into trouble. And if you wanted any proof—just look at
how Adam had run his ranch. A fool and his money were soon parted. Maybe that would teach
him a lesson. And he had doubled the output of the ice company.
Will Hamilton recalled that he had not only argued against it but had foretold in detail what
would happen. He did not feel pleasure, but what could you do when a man wouldn’t take advice
from a sound businessman? And, God knows, Will had plenty of experience with fly-by-night
ideas. In a roundabout way it was recalled that Sam Hamilton had been a fool too. And as for
Tom Hamilton—he had been just crazy.
When Lee felt that enough time had passed he did not beat around the bush. He sat directly in
front of Adam to get and to keep his attention.
“How do you feel?” he asked.
“All right.”
“You aren’t going to crawl back in your hole, are you?”

“What makes you think that?” Adam asked.
“Well, you have the look on your face you used to wear. And you’ve got that sleepwalker light in
your eyes. Does this hurt your feelings?”
“No,” said Adam. “The only thing I was wondering about was whether I’m wiped out.”
“Not quite,” said Lee. “You have about nine thou-sand dollars left and the ranch.”
“There’s a two-thousand-dollar bill for garbage dis-posal,” said Adam.
“That’s before the nine thousand.”
“I owe quite a bit for the new ice machinery.”
“That’s paid.”
“I have nine thousand?”
“And the ranch,” said Lee. “Maybe you can sell the ice plant.”
Adam’s face tightened up and lost the dazed smile. “I still believe it will work,” he said. “It was a
whole lot of accidents. I’m going to keep the ice plant. Cold does preserve things. Besides, the
plant makes some money. Maybe I can figure something out.”
“Try not to figure something that costs money,” said Lee. “I would hate to leave my gas stove.”

The twins felt Adam’s failure very deeply. They were fifteen years old and they had known so
long that they were sons of a wealthy man that the feeling was hard to lose. If only the affair had
not been a kind of carnival it would not have been so bad. They remembered the big placards on
the freight cars with horror. If the busi-nessmen made fun of Adam, the high-school group was
much more cruel. Overnight it became the thing to refer to the boys as “Aron and Cal Lettuce,” or
simply as “Lettuce-head.”
Aron discussed his problem with Abra. “It’s going to make a big difference,” he told her.
Abra had grown to be a beautiful girl. Her breasts were rising with the leaven of her years, and
her face had the calm and warmth of beauty. She had gone beyond prettiness. She was strong and
sure and femi-nine.
She looked at his worried face and asked, “Why is it going to make a difference?”
“Well, one thing, I think we’re poor.”
“You would have worked anyway.”
“You know I want to go to college.”
“You still can. I’ll help you. Did your father lose all his money?”
“I don’t know. That’s what they say.”
“Who is ‘they’?” Abra asked.
“Why, everybody. And maybe your father and mother won’t want you to marry me.”
“Then I won’t tell them about it,” said Abra,
“You’re pretty sure of yourself.”
“Yes,” she said, “I’m pretty sure of myself. Will you kiss me?”
“Right here? Right in the street?”
“Why not?”

“Everybody’d see.”
“I want them to,” said Abra.
Aron said, “No. I don’t like to make things public like that.”
She stepped around in front of him and stopped him. “You look here, mister. You kiss me now.”
“Why?”
She said slowly, “So everybody will know that I’m Mrs. Lettuce-head.”
He gave her a quick embarrassed peck and then forced her beside him again. “Maybe I ought to
call it off myself,” he said.
“What do you mean?”
“Well, I’m not good enough for you now. I’m just another poor kid. You think I haven’t seen the
differ-ence in your father?”
“You’re just crazy,” Abra said. And she frowned a little because she had seen the difference in
her father too.
They went into Bell’s candy store and sat at a table. The rage was celery tonic that year. The year
before it had been root-beer ice-cream sodas.
Abra stirred bubbles delicately with her straw and thought how her father had changed since the
lettuce failure. He had said to her, “Don’t you think it would be wise to see someone else for a
change?”
“But I’m engaged to Aron.”
“Engaged!” he snorted at her. “Since when do chil-dren get engaged? You’d better look around a
little. There are other fish in the sea.”
And she remembered that recently there had been references to suitability of families and once a
hint that some people couldn’t keep a scandal hidden forever. This had happened only when
Adam was reputed to have lost all of his money.”
She leaned across the table. “You know what we could really do is so simple it will make you
laugh.”
“What?”
“We could run your father’s ranch. My father says it’s beautiful land.”
“No,” Aron said quickly.
“Why not?”
“I’m not going to be a farmer and you’re not going to b? a farmer’s wife.”
“I’m going to be Aron’s wife, no matter what he is.”
“I’m not going to give up college,” he said.
“I’ll help you,” Abra said again.
“Where would you get the money?”
“Steal it,” she said.
“I want to get out of this town,” he said. “Every-body’s sneering at me. I can’t stand it here.”
“They’ll forget it pretty soon.”
“No, they won’t either. I don’t want to stay two years more to finish high school.”
“Do you want to go away from me, Aron?”

“No. Oh, damn it, why did he have to mess with things he doesn’t know about?”
Abra reproved him. “Don’t you blame your father. If it had worked everybody’d been bowing to
him.”
“Well, it didn’t work. He sure fixed me. I can’t hold up my head. By God! I hate him.”
Abra said sternly, “Aron! You stop talking like that!”
“How do I know he didn’t lie about my mother?”
Abra’s face reddened with anger. “You ought to be spanked,” she said. “If it wasn’t in front of
everybody I’d spank you myself.” She looked at his beautiful face, twisted now with rage and
frustration, and suddenly she changed her tactics. “Why don’t you ask about your mother? Just
come right out and ask him.”
“I can’t, I promised you.”
“You only promised not to say what I told you.”
“Well, if I asked him he’d want to know where I heard.”
“All right,” she cried, “you’re a spoiled baby! I let you out of your promise. Go ahead and ask
him.”
“I don’t know if I will or not.”
“Sometimes I want to kill you,” she said. “But Aron—I do love you so. I do love you so.” There
was gig-gling from the stools in front of the soda fountain. Their voices had risen and they were
overheard by their peers. Aron blushed and tears of anger started in his eyes. He ran out of the
store and plunged away up the street.
Abra calmly picked up her purse and straightened her skirt and brushed it with her hand. She
walked calmly over to Mr. Bell and paid for the celery tonics. On her way to the door she stopped
by the giggling group. “You let him alone,” she said coldly. She walked on, and a falsetto
followed her—”Oh, Aron, I do love you so.”
In the street she broke into a run to try to catch up with Aron, but she couldn’t find him. She
called on the telephone. Lee said that Aron had not come home. But Aron was in his bedroom,
lapped in resentments—Lee had seen him creep in and close his door behind him.
Abra walked up and down the streets of Salinas, hoping to catch sight of him. She was angry at
him, but she was also bewilderingly lonely, Aron hadn’t ever run away from her before. Abra had
lost her gift for being alone.
Cal had to learn loneliness. For a very short time he tried to join Abra and Aron, but they didn’t
want him. He was jealous and tried to attract the girl to himself and failed.
His studies he found easy and not greatly interesting. Aron had to work harder to learn, wherefore
Aron had a greater sense of accomplishment when he did learn, and he developed a respect for
learning out of all proportion to the quality of the learning. Cal drifted through. He didn’t care
much for the sports at school or for the activities. His growing restlessness drove him out at night.
He grew tall and rangy, and always there was the darkness about him.

Chapter 38
1
From his first memory Cal had craved warmth and af-fection, just as everyone does. If he had
been an only child or if Aron had been a different kind of boy, Cal might have achieved his
relationship normally and eas-ily. But from the very first people were won instantly to Aron by
his beauty and his simplicity. Cal very natural-ly competed for attention and affection in the only
way he knew—by trying to imitate Aron. And what was charming in the blond ingenuousness of
Aron became suspicious and unpleasant in the dark-faced, slit-eyed Cal. And since he was
pretending, his performance was not convincing. Where Aron was received, Cal was rebuffed for
doing or saying exactly the same thing.
And as a few strokes on the nose will make a puppy head shy, so a few rebuffs will make a boy
shy all over. But whereas a puppy will cringe away or roll on its back, groveling, a little boy may
cover his shyness with nonchalance, with bravado, or with secrecy. And once a boy has suffered
rejection, he will find rejection even where it does not exist—or, worse, will draw it forth from
people simply by expecting it.
In Cal the process had been so long and so slow that he felt no strangeness. He had built a wall of
self-sufficiency around himself, strong enough to defend him against the world. If his wall had
any weak places they may have been on the sides nearest Aron and Lee, and particularly nearest
Adam. Perhaps in his father’s very unawareness Cal had felt safety. Not being noticed at all was
better than being noticed adversely.
When he was quite small Cal had discovered a secret. If he moved very quietly to where his
father was sitting and if he leaned very lightly against his father’s knee, Adam’s hand would rise
automatically and his fingers would caress Cal’s shoulder. It is probable that Adam did not even
know he did it, but the caress brought such a raging flood of emotion to the boy that he saved this
special joy and used it only when he needed it. It was a magic to be depended upon. It was the
ceremonial symbol of a dogged adoration.
Things do not change with a change of scene. In Salinas, Cal had no more friends than he had had
in King City. Associates he had, and authority and some admiration, but friends he did not have.
He lived alone and walked alone.

2
If Lee knew that Cal left the house at night and returned very late, he gave no sign, since he
couldn’t do anything about it. The night constables sometimes saw him walking alone. Chief
Heiserman made it a point to speak to the truant officer, who assured him that Cal not only had
no record for playing hooky but actually was a very good student. The chief knew Adam of
course, and since Cal broke no windows and caused no disturbance he told the constables to keep

their eyes open but to let the boy alone unless he got into trouble.
Old Tom Watson caught up with Cal one night and asked, “Why do you walk around so much at
night?”
“I’m not bothering anybody,” said Cal defensively.
“I know you’re not. But you ought to be home in bed.”
“I’m not sleepy,” said Cal, and this didn’t make any sense at all to Old Tom, who couldn’t
remember any time in his whole life when he wasn’t sleepy. The boy looked in on the fan-tan
games in Chinatown, but he didn’t play. It was a mystery, but then fairly simple things were
mysteries to Tom Watson and he preferred to leave them that way.
On his walks Cal often recalled the conversation between Lee and Adam he had heard on the
ranch. He wanted to dig out the truth. And his knowledge ac-cumulated slowly, a reference heard
in the street, the gibing talk in the pool hall. If Aron had heard the fragments he would not have
noticed, but Cal collected them. He knew that his mother was not dead. He knew also, both from
the first conversation and from the talk he heard, that Aron was not likely to be pleased at
discovering her.
One night Cal ran into Rabbit Holman, who was up from San Ardo on his semi-annual drunk.
Rabbit greeted Cal effusively, as a country man always greets an acquaintance in a strange place.
Rabbit, drinking from a pint flask in the alley behind the Abbot House, told Cal all the news he
could think of. He had sold a piece of his land at a fine price and he was in Salinas to celebrate,
and celebration meant the whole shebang. He was going down the Line and show the whores
what a real man could do.
Cal sat quietly beside him, listening. When the whisky got low in Rabbit’s pint Cal slipped away
and got Louis Schneider to buy him another one. And Rabbit put down his empty pint and
reached for it again and came up with a full pint.
“Funny,” he said, “thought I only had one. Well, it’s a good mistake.”
Halfway down the second pint Rabbit had not only forgotten who Cal was but how old he was.
He remem-bered, however, that his companion was his very dear old friend.
“Tell you what, George,” he said. “You let me get a little more of this here lead in my pencil and
you and me will go down the Line. Now don’t say you can’t afford it. The whole shebang’s on
me. Did I tell you I sold forty acres? Wasn’t no good neither.”
And he said, “Harry, tell you what let’s do. Let’s keep away from them two-bit whores. We’ll go
to Kate’s place. Costs high, ten bucks, but what the hell! They got a circus down there. Ever seen
a circus, Harry? Well, it’s a lulu. Kate sure knows her stuff. You remember who Kate is, don’t
you, George? She’s Adam Trask’s wife, mother of them damn twins. Jesus! I never forget the
time she shot him and ran away. Plugged him in the shoulder and just runoff. Well, she wasn’t no
good as a wife but she’s sure as hell a good whore. Funny too—you know how they say a whore
makes a good wife? Ain’t nothing new for them to experiment with. Help me up a little, will you,
Harry? What was I saying?”
“Circus,” said Cal softly.
“Oh, yeah. Well, this circus of Kate’s will pop your eyes out. Know what they do?”

Cal walked a little behind so that Rabbit would not notice him. Rabbit told what they did. And
what they did wasn’t what made Cal sick. That just seemed to him silly. It was the men who
watched. Seeing Rabbit’s face under the streetlights, Cal knew what the watchers at the circus
would be like.
They went through the overgrown yard and up on the unpainted porch. Although Cal was tall for
his age he walked high on his toes. The guardian of the door didn’t look at him very closely. The
dim room with its low secret lamps and the nervous waiting men con-cealed his presence.

3
Always before, Cal wanted to build a dark accumula-tion of things seen and things heard—a kind
of a warehouse of materials that, like obscure tools, might come in handy, but after the visit to
Kate’s he felt a desperate need for help.
One night Lee, tapping away at his typewriter, heard a quiet knock on his door and let Cal in. The
boy sat down on the edge of the bed, and Lee let his thin body down in the Morris chair. He was
amused that a chair could give him so much pleasure. Lee folded his hands over his stomach as
though he wore Chinese sleeves and waited patiently. Cal was looking at a spot in the air right
over Lee’s head.
Cal spoke softly and rapidly. “I know where my mother is and what she’s doing. I saw her.”
Lee’s mind said a convulsive prayer for guidance. “What do you want to know?” he asked softly.
“I haven’t thought yet. I’m trying to think. Would you tell me the truth?”
“Of course.”
The questions whirling in Cal’s head were so bewildering he had trouble picking one out. “Does
my father know?”
“Yes.”
“Why did he say she was dead?”
“To save you from pain.”
Cal considered. “What did my father do to make her leave?”
“He loved her with his whole mind and body. He gave her everything he could imagine.”
“Did she shoot him?”
“Yes.”
“Why?”
“Because he didn’t want her to go away.”
“Did he ever hurt her?”
“Not that I know of. It wasn’t in him to hurt her.”
“Lee, why did she do it?”
“I don’t know.”
“Don’t know or won’t say?”
“Don’t know.”
Cal was silent for so long that Lee’s fingers began to creep a little, holding to his wrists. He was
relieved when Cal spoke again. The boy’s tone was different. There was a pleading in it.

“Lee, you knew her. What was she like?”
Lee sighed and his hands relaxed. “I can only say what I think. I may be wrong.”
“Well, what did you think?”
“Cal,” he said, “I’ve thought about it for a great many hours and I still don’t know. She is a
mystery. It seems to me that she is not like other people. There is something she lacks. Kindness
maybe, or conscience. You can only understand people if you feel them in yourself. And I can’t
feel her. The moment I think about her my feeling goes into darkness. I don’t know what she
wanted or what she was after. She was full of hatred, but why or toward what I don’t know. It’s a
mystery. And her hatred wasn’t healthy. It wasn’t angry. It was heartless. I don’t know that it is
good to talk to you like this.”
“I need to know.”
“Why? Didn’t you feel better before you knew?”
“Yes. But I can’t stop now.”
“You’re right,” said Lee. “When the first innocence goes, you can’t stop—unless you’re a
hypocrite or a fool. But I can’t tell you any more because I don’t know any more.
Cal said, “Tell me about my father then.”
“That I can do,” said Lee. He paused. “I wonder if anyone can hear us talking? Speak softly.”
“Tell me about him,” said Cal.
“I think your father has in him, magnified, the things his wife lacks. I think in him kindness and
conscience are so large that they are almost faults. They trip him up and hinder him.”
“What did he do when she left?”
“He died,” said Lee. “He walked around but he was dead. And only recently has he come half to
life again.” Lee saw a strange new expression on Cal’s face. The eyes were open wider, and the
mouth, ordinarily tight and muscular, was relaxed. In his face, now for the first time, Lee could
see Aron’s face in spite of the different coloring. Cal’s shoulders were shaking a little, like a
muscle too long held under a strain.
“What is it, Cal?” Lee asked.
“I love him,” Cal said.
“I love him too,” said Lee. “I guess I couldn’t have stayed around so long if I hadn’t. He is not
smart in a worldly sense but he’s a good man. Maybe the best man I have ever known.”
Cal stood up suddenly. “Good night, Lee,” he said.
“Now you wait just a moment. Have you told any-one?”
“No.”
“Not Aron—no, of course you wouldn’t.”
“Suppose he finds out?”
“Then you’d have to stand by to help him. Don’t go yet. When you leave this room we may not
be able to talk again. You may dislike me for knowing you know the truth. Tell me this—do you
hate your mother?”
“Yes,” said Cal.
“I wondered,” said Lee. “I don’t think your father ever hated her. He had only sorrow.”

Cal drifted toward the door, slowly, softly. He shoved his fists deep in his pockets. “It’s like you
said about knowing people. I hate her because I know why she went away. I know—because I’ve
got her in me.” His head was down and his voice was heartbroken.
Lee jumped up. “You stop that!” he said sharply. “You hear me? Don’t let me catch you doing
that. Of course you may have that in you. Everybody has. But you’ve got the other too. Here—
look up! Look at me!”
Cal raised his head and said wearily, “What do you want?”
“You’ve got the other too. Listen to me! You wouldn’t even be wondering if you didn’t have it.
Don’t you dare take the lazy way. It’s too easy to excuse yourself because of your ancestry. Don’t
let me catch you doing it! Now—look close at me so you will remember. Whatever you do, it
will be you who do it—not your mother.”
“Do you believe that, Lee?”
“Yes, I believe it, and you’d better believe it or I’ll break every bone in your body.”
After Cal had gone Lee went back to his chair. He thought ruefully, I wonder what happened to
my Orien-tal repose?

Cal’s discovery of his mother was more a verification than a new thing to him. For a long time he
had known without details that the cloud was there. And his reac-tion was twofold. He had an
almost pleasant sense of power in knowing, and he could evaluate actions and expressions, could
interpret vague references, could even dip up and reorganize the past. But these did not
compensate for the pain in his knowledge.
His body was rearranging itself toward manhood, and he was shaken by the veering winds of
adoles-cence. One moment he was dedicated and pure and devoted; the next he wallowed in filth;
and the next he groveled in shame and emerged rededicated.
His discovery sharpened all of his emotions. It seemed to him that he was unique, having such a
heritage. He could not quite believe Lee’s words or conceive that other boys were going through
the same thing.
The circus at Kate’s remained with him. At one moment the memory inflamed his mind and body
with pubescent fire, and the next moment nauseated him with revulsion and loathing.
He looked at his father more closely and saw per-haps more sadness and frustration in Adam than
may have been there. And in Cal there grew up a passionate love for his father and a wish to
protect him and to make it up to him for the things he had suffered. In Cal’s own sensitized mind
that suffering was unbear-able. He blundered into the bathroom while Adam was bathing and saw
the ugly bullet scar and heard himself ask against his will, “Father, what’s that scar?”
Adam’s fingers went up as though to conceal the scar. He said, “It’s an old wound, Cal. I was in
the Indian campaigns. I’ll tell you about it some time.”
Cal, watching Adam’s face, had seen his mind leap into the past for a lie. Cal didn’t hate the lie
but the necessity for telling it. Cal lied for reasons of profit of one kind or another. To be driven
to a lie seemed shameful to him. He wanted to shout, “I know how you got it and it’s all right.”

But, of course, he did not. “I’d like to hear about it,” he said.
Aron was caught in the roil of change too, but his impulses were more sluggish than Cal’s. His
body did not scream at him so shrilly. His passions took a reli-gious direction. He decided on the
ministry for his future. He attended all services in the Episcopal church, helped with the flowers
and leaves at feast times, and spent many hours with the young and curly-haired clergyman, Mr.
Rolf. Aron’s training in worldliness was gained from a young man of no experience, which gave
him the agility for generalization only the inexperienced can have.
Aron was confirmed in the Episcopal church and took his place in the choir on Sundays. Abra
followed him. Her feminine mind knew that such things were necessary but unimportant.
It was natural that the convert Aron should work on Cal. First Aron prayed silently for Cal, but
finally he approached him. He denounced Cal’s godlessness, de-manded his reformation.
Cal might have tried to go along if his brother had been more clever. But Aron had reached a
point of passionate purity that made everyone else foul. After a few lectures Cal found him
unbearably smug and told him so. It was a relief to both of them when Aron abandoned his
brother to eternal damnation.
Aron’s religion inevitably took a sexual turn. He spoke to Abra of the necessity for abstinence
and de-cided that he would live a life of celibacy. Abra in her wisdom agreed with him, feeling
and hoping that this phase would pass. Celibacy was the only state she had known. She wanted to
marry Aron and bear any num-ber of his children, but for the time being she did not speak of it.
She had never been jealous before, but now she began to find in herself an instinctive and perhaps
justified hatred of the Reverend Mr. Rolf.
Cal watched his brother triumph over sins he had never committed. He thought sardonically of
telling him about his mother, to see how he would handle it, but he withdrew the thought quickly.
He didn’t think Aron could handle it at all.

Chapter 39
1
At intervals Salinas suffered from a mild eructation of morality. The process never varied much.
One burst was like another. Sometimes it started in the pulpit and sometimes with a new
ambitious president of the Wom-en’s Civic Club. Gambling was invariably the sin to be
eradicated. There were certain advantages in attacking gambling. One could discuss it, which was
not true of prostitution. It was an obvious evil and most of the games were operated by Chinese.
There was little chance of treading on the toes of a relative.
From church and club the town’s two newspapers caught fire. Editorials demanded a clean-up.
The police agreed but pleaded short-handedness and tried for in-creased budget and sometimes
succeeded.
When it got to the editorial stage everyone knew the cards were down. What followed was as
carefully pro-duced as a ballet. The police got ready, the gambling houses got ready, and the
papers set up congratulatory editorials in advance. Then came the raid, deliberate and sure.
Twenty or more Chinese, imported from Pajaro, a few bums, six or eight drummers, who, being
strangers, were not warned, fell into the police net, were booked, jailed, and in the morning fined
and released. The town relaxed in its new spotlessness and the houses lost only one night of
business plus the fines. It is one of the triumphs of the human that he can know a thing and still
not believe it.
In the fall of 1916 Cal was watching the fan-tan game at Shorty Lim’s one night when the raid
scooped him up. In the dark no one noticed him, and the chief was embarrassed to find him in the
tank in the morn-ing. The chief telephoned Adam, got him up from his breakfast. Adam walked
the two blocks to the City Hall, picked up Cal, crossed the street to the post office for his mail,
and then the two walked home.
Lee had kept Adam’s eggs warm and had fried two for Cal.
Aron walked through the dining room on his way to school. “Want me to wait for you?” he asked
Cal.
“No,” said Cal. He kept his eyes down and ate his eggs.
Adam had not spoken except to say, “Come along!” at the City Hall after he had thanked the
Chief.
Cal gulped down a breakfast he did not want, dart-ing glances up through his eyelashes at his
father’s face. He could make nothing of Adam’s expression. It seemed at once puzzled and angry
and thoughtful and sad.
Adam stared down into his coffee cup. The silence grew until it had the weight of age so hard to
lift aside.

Lee looked in. “Coffee?” he asked.
Adam shook his head slowly. Lee withdrew and this time closed the kitchen door.
In the clock-ticking silence Cal began to be afraid. He felt a strength flowing out of his father he
had never known was there. Itching prickles of agony ran up his legs, and he was afraid to move
to restore the circula-tion. He knocked his fork against his plate to make a noise and the clatter
was swallowed up. The clock struck nine deliberate strokes and they were swallowed up.
As the fear began to chill, resentment took its place. So might a trapped fox feel anger at the paw
which held him to the trap.
Suddenly Cal jumped up. He hadn’t known he was going to move. He shouted and he hadn’t
known he was going to speak. He cried, “Do what you’re going to do to me! Go ahead! Get it
over!”
And his shout was sucked into the silence.
Adam slowly raised his head. It is true that Cal had never looked into his father’s eyes before, and
it is true that many people never look into their father’s eyes. Adam’s irises were light blue with
dark radial lines lead-ing into the vortices of his pupils. And deep down in each pupil Cal saw his
own face reflected, as though two Cals looked out at him.
Adam said slowly, “I’ve failed you, haven’t I?”
It was worse than an attack. Cal faltered, “What do you mean?”
“You were picked up in a gambling house. I don’t know how you got there, what you were doing
there, why you went there.”
Cal sat limply down and looked at his plate.
“Do you gamble, son?”
“No, sir. I was just watching.”
“Had you been there before?”
“Yes, sir. Many times.”
“Why do you go?”
“I don’t know. I get restless at night—like an alley cat, I guess.” The thought of Kate and his
weak joke seemed horrible to him. “When I can’t sleep I walk around,” he said, “to try to blot it
out.”
Adam considered his words, inspected each one. “Does your brother walk around too?”
“Oh, no, sir. He wouldn’t think of it. He’s—he’s not restless.”
“You see, I don’t know,” said Adam. “I don’t know anything about you.”
Cal wanted to throw his arms about his father, to hug him and to be hugged by him. He wanted
some wild demonstration of sympathy and love. He picked up his wooden napkin ring and thrust
his forefinger through it. “I’d tell you if you asked,” he said softly.
“I didn’t ask. I didn’t ask! I’m as bad a father as my father was.”
Cal had never heard this tone in Adam’s voice. It was hoarse and breaking with warmth and he
fumbled among his words, feeling for them in the dark.
“My father made a mold and forced me into it,” Adam said. “I was a bad casting but I couldn’t be
remelted. Nobody can be remelted. And so I remained a bad casting.”

Cal said, “Sir, don’t be sorry. You’ve had too much of that.”
“Have I? Maybe—but maybe the wrong kind. I don’t know my sons. I wonder whether I could
learn.”
“I’ll tell you anything you want to know. Just ask me.”
“Where would I start? Right at the beginning?”
“Are you sad or mad because I was in jail?”
To Cal’s surprise Adam laughed. “You were just there, weren’t you? You didn’t do anything
wrong.”
“Maybe being there was wrong.” Cal wanted a blame for himself.
“One time I was just there,” said Adam. “I was a prisoner for nearly a year for just being there.”
Cal tried to absorb this heresy. “I don’t believe it,” he said.
“Sometimes I don’t either, but I know that when I escaped I robbed a store and stole some
clothes.”
“I don’t believe it,” Cal said weakly, but the warmth, the closeness, was so delicious that he clung
to it. He breathed shallowly so that the warmth might not be disturbed.
Adam said, “Do you remember Samuel Hamilton?—sure you do. When you were a baby he told
me I was a bad father. He hit me, knocked me down, to impress it on me.”
“That old man?”
“He was a tough old man. And now I know what he meant. I’m the same as my father was. He
didn’t allow me to be a person, and I haven’t seen my sons as people. That’s what Samuel
meant.” He looked right into Cal’s eyes and smiled, and Cal ached with affection for him.
Cal said, “We don’t think you’re a bad father.”
“Poor things,” said Adam. “How would you know? You’ve never had any other kind.”
“I’m glad I was in jail,” said Cal.
“So am I. So am I.” He laughed. “We’ve both been in jail—we can talk together.” A gaiety grew
in him. “Maybe you can tell me what kind of a boy you are—can you?”
“Yes sir.”
“Will you?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Well, tell me. You see, there’s a responsibility in being a person. It’s more than just taking up
space where air would be. What are you like?”
“No joke?” Cal asked shyly.
“No joke—oh, surely, no joke. Tell me about your-self—that is, if you want to.”
Cal began, “Well—I’m—” He stopped. “It’s not so easy when you try,” he said.
“I guess it would be—maybe impossible. Tell me about your brother.”
“What do you want to know about him?”
“What you think of him, I guess. That’s all you could tell me.”
Cal said, “He’s good. He doesn’t do bad things. He doesn’t think bad things.”
“Now you’re telling about yourself.”
“Sir?”

“You’re saying you do and think bad things.”
Cal’s cheeks reddened. “Well, I do.”
“Very bad things?”
“Yes, sir. Do you want me to tell?”
“No, Cal. You’ve told. Your voice tells and your eyes tell you’re at war with yourself. But you
shouldn’t be ashamed. It’s awful to be ashamed. Is Aron ever ashamed?”
“He doesn’t do anything to be ashamed of.”
Adam leaned forward. “Are you sure?”
“Pretty sure.”
“Tell me, Cal—do you protect him?”
“How do you mean, sir?”
“I mean like this—if you heard something bad or cruel or ugly, would you keep it from him?”
“I—I think so.”
“You think he’s too weak to bear things you can bear?”
“It’s not that, sir. He’s good. He’s really good. He never does anyone harm. He never says bad
things about anyone. He’s not mean and he never complains and he’s brave. He doesn’t like to
fight but he will.”
“You love your brother, don’t you?”
“Yes, sir. And I do bad things to him. I cheat him and I fool him. Sometimes I hurt him for no
reason at all.”
“And then you’re miserable?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Is Aron ever miserable?”
“I don’t know. When I didn’t want to join the Church he felt bad. And once when Abra got angry
and said she hated him he felt awful bad. He was sick. He had a fever. Don’t you remember? Lee
sent for the doctor.”
Adam said with wonder, “I could live with you and not know any of these things! Why was Abra
mad?”
Cal said, “I don’t know if I ought to tell.”
“I don’t want you to then.”
“It’s nothing bad. I guess it’s all right. You see, sir, Aron wants to be a minister. Mr. Rolf—well,
he likes high church, and Aron liked that, and he thought maybe he would never get married and
maybe go to a retreat.”
“Like a monk, you mean?”
“Yes, sir.”
“And Abra didn’t like that?”
“Like it? She got spitting mad. She can get mad sometimes. She took Aron’s fountain pen and
threw it on the sidewalk and tramped on it. She said she’d wasted half her life on Aron.”
Adam laughed. “How old is Abra?”
“Nearly fifteen. But she’s—well, more than that some ways.”

“I should say she is. What did Aron do?”
“He just got quiet but he felt awful bad.”
Adam said, “I guess you could have taken her away from him then.”
“Abra is Aron’s girl,” said Cal.
Adam looked deeply into Cal’s eyes. Then he called, “Lee!” There was no answer. “Lee!” he
called again. He said, ‘“I didn’t hear him go out. I want some fresh coffee.”
Cal jumped up. “I’ll make it.”
“Say,” said Adam, “you should be in school.”
“I don’t want to go.”
“You ought to go. Aron went.”
“I’m happy,” Cal said. “I want to be with you.”
Adam looked down at his hands. “Make the coffee,” he said softly and his voice was shy.
When Cal was in the kitchen Adam looked inward at himself with wonder. His nerves and
muscles throbbed with an excited hunger. His fingers yearned to grasp, his legs to run. His eyes
avidly brought the room into focus. He saw the chairs, the pictures, the red roses on the carpet,
and new sharp things—almost people things but friendly things. And in his brain was born sharp
appetite for the future—a pleased warm antici-pation, as though the coming minutes and weeks
must bring delight. He felt a dawn emotion, with a lovely day to slip golden and quiet over him.
He laced his fingers behind his head and stretched his legs out stiff.
In the kitchen Cal urged on the water heating in the coffeepot, and yet he was pleased to be
waiting. A miracle once it is familiar is no longer a miracle; Cal had lost his wonder at the golden
relationship with his father but the pleasure remained. The poison of lone-liness and the gnawing
envy of the unlonely had gone out of him, and his person was clean and sweet, and he knew it
was. He dredged up an old hatred to test him-self, and he found the hatred gone. He wanted to
serve his father, to give him some great gift, to perform some huge good task in honor of his
father.
The coffee boiled over and Cal spent minutes clean-ing up the stove. He said to himself, “I
wouldn’t have done this yesterday.”
Adam smiled at him when he carried in the steaming pot. Adam sniffed and said, “That’s a smell
could raise me out of a concrete grave.”
“It boiled over,” said Cal.
“It has to boil over to taste good,” Adam said. “I wonder where Lee went.”
“Maybe in his room. Shall I look?”
“No. He’d have answered.”
“Sir, when I finish school, will you let me run the ranch?”
“You’re planning early. How about Aron?”
“He wants to go to college. Don’t tell him I told you. Let him tell you, and you be surprised.”
“Why, that’s fine,” said Adam. “But don’t you want to go to college too?”
“I bet I could make money on the ranch—enough to pay Aron’s way through college.”
Adam sipped his coffee. “That’s a generous thing,” he said. “I don’t know whether I ought to tell

you this but—well, when I asked you earlier what kind of boy Aron was, you defended him so
badly I thought you might dislike him or even hate him.”
“I have hated him,” Cal said vehemently. “And I’ve hurt him too. But, sir, can I tell you
something? I don’t hate him now. I won’t ever hate him again. I don’t think I will hate anyone,
not even my mother—” He stopped, astonished at his slip, and his mind froze up tight and
helpless.
Adam looked straight ahead. He rubbed his forehead with the palm of his hand. Finally he said
quietly, “You know about your mother.” It was not a question.
“Yes—yes, sir.”
“All about her?”
“Yes, sir.”
Adam leaned back in his chair. “Does Aron know?”
“Oh, no! No—no, sir. He doesn’t know.”
“Why do you say it that way?”
“I wouldn’t dare to tell him.”
“Why not?”
Cal said brokenly, “I don’t think he could stand it. He hasn’t enough badness in him to stand it.”
He wanted to continue, “—any more than you could, sir,” but he left the last unsaid.
Adam’s face looked weary. He moved his head from side to side. “Cal, listen to me. Do you think
there’s any chance of keeping Aron from knowing? Think carefully.”
Cal said, “He doesn’t go near places like that. He’s not like me.”
“Suppose someone told him?”
“I don’t think he would believe it, sir. I think he would lick whoever told him and think it was a
lie.”
“You’ve been there?”
“Yes, sir. I had to know.” And Cal went on excited-ly, “If he went away to college and never
lived in this town again—”
Adam nodded. “Yes. That might be. But he has two more years here.”
“Maybe I could make him hurry it up and finish in one year. He’s smart.”
“But you’re smarter?”
“A different kind of smart,” said Cal.
Adam seemed to grow until he filled one side of the room. His face was stern and his blue eyes
sharp and penetrating. “Cal!” he said harshly.
“Sir?”
“I trust you, son,” said Adam.

2
Adam’s recognition brought a ferment of happiness to Cal. He walked on the balls of his feet. He
smiled more often than he frowned, and the secret darkness was seldom on him.
Lee, noticing the change in him, asked quietly, “You haven’t found a girl, have you?”

“Girl? No. Who wants a girl?”
“Everybody,” said Lee.
And Lee asked Adam, “Do you know what’s got into Cal?”
Adam said, “He knows about her.”
“Does he?” Lee stayed out of trouble. “Well, you remember I thought you should have told them.”
“I didn’t tell him. He knew.”
“What do you think of that!” said Lee. “But that’s not information to make a boy hum when he
studies and play catch with his cap when he walks. How about Aron?”
“I’m afraid of that,” said Adam. “I don’t think I want him to know.”
“It might be too late.”
“I might have a talk with Aron. Kind of feel around.”
Lee considered. “Something’s happened to you too.”
“Has it? I guess it has,” said Adam.
But humming and sailing his cap, driving quickly through his schoolwork, were only the smallest
of Cal’s activities. In his new joy he appointed himself guardian of his father’s content. It was
true what he had said about not feeling hatred for his mother. But that did not change the fact that
she had been the instrument of Adam’s hurt and shame. Cal reasoned that what she could do
before, she could do again. He set himself to learn all he could about her. A known enemy is less
dangerous, less able to surprise.
At night he was drawn to the house across the tracks. Sometimes in the afternoon he lay hidden in
the tall weeds across the street, watching the place. He saw the girls come out, dressed somberly,
even severely. They left the house always in pairs, and Cal followed them with his eyes to the
corner of Castroville Street, where they turned left toward Main Street. He discov-ered that if you
didn’t know where they had come from you couldn’t tell what they were. But he was not wait-ing
for the girls to come out. He wanted to see his mother in the light of day. He found that Kate
emerged every Monday at one-thirty.
Cal made arrangements in school, by doing extra and excellent work, to make up for his absences
on Monday afternoons. To Aron’s questions he replied that he was working on a surprise and was
duty bound to tell no one. Aron was not much interested anyway. In his self-immersion Aron
soon forgot the whole thing.
Cal, after he had followed Kate several times, knew her route. She always went to the same places
—first to the Monterey County Bank where she was admitted behind the shining bars that
defended the safe-deposit vault. She spent fifteen or twenty minutes there. Then she moved
slowly along Main Street, looking in the store windows. She stepped into Porter and Irvine’s and
looked at dresses and sometimes made a purchase—elastic, safety pins, a veil, a pair of gloves.
About two-fifteen she entered Minnie Franken’s beauty parlor, stayed an hour, and came out with
her hair pinned up in tight curls and a silk scarf around her head and tied under her chin.
At three-thirty she climbed the stairs to the offices over the Farmers’ Mercantile and went into the
consult-ing room of Dr. Rosen. When she came down from the doctor’s office she stopped for a
moment at Bell’s candy store and bought a two-pound box of mixed chocolates. She never varied

the route. From Bell’s she went direct-ly back to Castroville Street and thence to her house.
There was nothing strange about her clothing. She dressed exactly like any well-to-do Salinas
woman out shopping on a Monday afternoon—except that she al-ways wore gloves, which was
unusual for Salinas.
The gloves made her hands seem puffed and pudgy. She moved as though she were surrounded
by a glass shell. She spoke to no one and seemed to see no one. Occasionally a man turned and
looked after her and then nervously went about his business. But for the most part she slipped
past like an invisible woman.
For a number of weeks Cal followed Kate. He tried not to attract her attention. And since Kate
walked always looking straight ahead, he was convinced that she did not notice him.
When Kate entered her own yard Cal strolled casual-ly by and went home by another route. He
could not have said exactly why he followed her, except that he wanted to know all about her.
The eighth week he took the route she completed her journey and went into her overgrown yard
as usual.
Cal waited a moment, then strolled past the rickety gate.
Kate was standing behind a tall ragged privet. She said to him coldly, “What do you want?”
Cal froze in his steps. He was suspended in time, barely breathing. Then he began a practice he
had learned when he was very young. He observed and catalogued details outside his main
object. He noticed how the wind from the south bent over the new little leaves of the tall privet
bush. He saw the muddy path beaten to black mush by many feet, and Kate’s feet standing far to
the side out of the mud. He heard a switch engine in the Southern Pacific yards discharging steam
in shrill dry spurts. He felt the chill air on the growing fuzz on his cheeks. And all the time he
was staring at Kate and she was staring back at him. And he saw in the set and color of her eyes
and hair, even in the way she held her shoulders—high in a kind of semi-shrug—that Aron
looked very like her. He did not know his own face well enough to recognize her mouth and little
teeth and wide cheekbones as his own. They stood thus for the moment, between two gusts of the
southern wind.
Kate said, “This isn’t the first time you’ve followed me. What do you want?”
He dipped his head. “Nothing,” he said.
“Who told you to do it?” she demanded.
“Nobody—ma’am.”
“You won’t tell me, will you?”
Cal heard his own next speech with amazement. It was out before he could stop it. “You’re my
mother and I wanted to see what you’re like.” It was the exact truth and it had leaped out like the
stroke of a snake.
“What? What is this? Who are you?”
“I’m Cal Trask,” he said. He felt the delicate change of balance as when a seesaw moves. His was
the upper seat now. Although her expression had not changed Cal knew she was on the defensive.
She looked at him closely, observed every feature. A dim remembered picture of Charles leaped
into her mind. Suddenly she said, “Come with me!” She turned and walked up the path, keeping

well to the side, out of the mud.
Cal hesitated only for a moment before following her up the steps. He remembered the big dim
room, but the rest was strange to him. Kate preceded him down a hall and into her room. As she
went past the kitchen en-trance she called, “Tea. Two cups!”
In her room she seemed to have forgotten him!. She removed her coat, tugging at the sleeves with
reluctant fat gloved fingers. Then she went to a new door cut in the wall in the end of the room
where her bed stood. She opened the door and went into a new little lean-to. “Come in here!” she
said. “Bring that chair with you.”
He followed her into a box of a room. It had no windows, no decorations of any kind. Its walls
were painted a dark gray. A solid gray carpet covered the floor. The only furniture in the room
was a huge chair puffed with gray silk cushions, a tilted reading table, and a floor lamp deeply
hooded. Kate pulled the light chain with her gloved hand, holding it deep in the crotch between
her thumb and forefinger as though her hand were artificial.
“Close the door!” Kate said.
The light threw a circle on the reading table and only diffused dimly through the gray room.
Indeed the gray walls seemed to suck up the light and destroy it.
Kate settled herself gingerly among the thick down cushions and slowly removed her gloves. The
fingers of both hands were bandaged.
Kate said angrily, “Don’t stare. It’s arthritis. Oh—so you want to see, do you?” She unwrapped
the oily-looking bandage from her right forefinger and stuck the crooked finger under the light.
“There—look at it,” she said. “It’s arthritis.” She whined in pain as she tenderly wrapped the
bandage loosely. “God, those gloves hurt!” she said. “Sit down.”
Cal crouched on the edge of his chair.
“You’ll probably get it,” Kate said. “My great-aunt had it and my mother was just beginning to
get it—” She stopped. The room was very silent.
There was a soft knock on the door. Kate called, “Is that you, Joe? Set the tray down out there.
Joe, are you there?”
A mutter came through the door.
Kate said tonelessly, “There’s a litter in the parlor. Clean it up. Anne hasn’t cleaned her room.
Give her one more warning. Tell her it’s the last. Eva got smart last night. I’ll take care of her.
And, Joe, tell the cook if he serves carrots again this week he can pack up. Hear me?”
The mutter came through the door.
“That’s all,” said Kate. “The dirty pigs!” she mut-tered. “They’d rot if I didn’t watch them. Go
out and bring in the tea tray.”
The bedroom was empty when Cal opened the door. He carried the tray into the lean-to and set it
gingerly on the tilted reading table. It was a large silver tray, and on it were a pewter teapot, two
paper-thin white teacups, sugar, cream, and an open box of chocolates.
“Pour the tea,” said Kate. “It hurts my hands.” She put a chocolate in her mouth. “I saw you
looking at this room,” she went on when she had swallowed her candy. “The light hurts my eyes.
I come in here to rest.” She saw Cal’s quick glance at her eyes and said with finality, “The light

hurts my eyes.” She said harsh-ly, “What’s the matter? Don’t you want tea?”
“No, ma’am,” said Cal, “I don’t like tea.”
She held the thin cup with her bandaged fingers. “All right. What do you want?”
“Nothing, ma’am.”
“Just wanted to look at me?”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Are you satisfied?”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“How do I look?” She smiled crookedly at him and showed her sharp white little teeth.
“All right.”
“I might have known you’d cover up. Where’s your brother?”
“In school, I guess, or home.”
“What’s he like?”
“He looks more like you.”
“Oh, he does? Well, is he like me ?”
“He wants to be a minister,” said Cal.
“I guess that’s the way it should be—looks like me and wants to go into the church. A man can
do a lot of damage in the church. When someone comes here, he’s got his guard up. But in church
a man’s wide open.”
“He means it,” said Cal.
She leaned toward him, and her face was alive with interest. “Fill my cup. Is your brother dull?”
“He’s nice,” said Cal.
“I asked you if he’s dull.”
“No, ma’am,” said Cal.
She settled back and lifted her cup. “How’s your father?”
“I don’t want to talk about him,” Cal said.
“Oh, no! You like him then?”
“I love him,” said Cal.
Kate peered closely at him, and a curious spasm shook her—an aching twist rose in her chest.
And then she closed up and her control came back.
“Don’t you want some candy?” she asked.
“Yes, ma’am. Why did you do it?”
“Why did I do what?”
“Why did you shoot my father and run away from us.”
“Did he tell you that?”
“No. He didn’t tell us.”
She touched one hand with the other and her hands leaped apart as though the contact burned
them. She asked, “Does your father ever have any—girls or young women come to your house?”
“No,” said Cal. “Why did you shoot him and go away?”
Her cheeks tightened and her mouth straightened, as though a net of muscles took control. She

raised her head, and her eyes were cold and shallow.
“You talk older than your age,” she said. “But you don’t talk old enough. Maybe you’d better run
along and play—and wipe your nose.”
“Sometimes I work my brother over,” he said. “I make him squirm, I’ve made him cry. He
doesn’t know how I do it. I’m smarter than he is. I don’t want to do it. It makes me sick.”
Kate picked it up as though it were her own conver-sation. “They thought they were so smart,”
she said. “They looked at me and thought they knew about me. And I fooled them. I fooled every
one of them. And when they thought they could tell me what to do—oh! that’s when I fooled
them best. Charles, I really fooled them then.”
“My name is Caleb,” Cal said. “Caleb got to the Promised Land. That’s what Lee says, and it’s in
the Bible.”
“That’s the Chinaman,” Kate said, and she went on eagerly, “Adam thought he had me. When I
was hurt, all broken up, he took me in and he waited on me, cooked for me. He tried to tie me
down that way. Most people get tied down that way. They’re grateful, they’re in debt, and that’s
the worst kind of handcuffs. But nobody can hold me. I waited and waited until I was strong, and
then I broke out. Nobody can trap me,” she said. “I knew what he was doing. I waited.”
The gray room was silent except for her excited wheezing breath.
Cal said, “Why did you shoot him?”
“Because he tried to stop me. I could have killed him but I didn’t. I just wanted him to let me go.”
“Did you ever wish you’d stayed?”
“Christ, no! Even when I was a little girl I could do anything I wanted. They never knew how I
did it. Never. They were always so sure they were right. And they never knew—no one ever
knew.” A kind of real-ization came to her. “Sure, you’re my kind. Maybe you’re the same. Why
wouldn’t you be?”
Cal stood up and clasped his hands behind his back. He said, “When you were little, did you”—
he paused to get the thought straight—”did you ever have the feeling like you were missing
something? Like as if the others knew something you didn’t—like a secret they wouldn’t tell
you? Did you ever feel that way?”
While he spoke her face began to close against him, and by the time he paused she was cut off
and the open way between them was blocked.
She said, “What am I doing, talking to kids!”
Cal unclasped his hands from behind him and shoved them in his pockets.
“Talking to snot-nosed kids,” she said. “I must be crazy.”
Cal’s face was alight with excitement, and his eyes were wide with vision.
Kate said, “What’s the matter with you?”
He stood still, his forehead glistening with sweat, his hands clenched into fists.
Kate, as she had always, drove in the smart but senseless knife of her cruelty. She laughed softly.
“I may have given you some interesting things, like this—” She held up her crooked hands. “But
if it’s epilepsy—fits—you didn’t get it from me.” She glanced brightly up at him, anticipating the
shock and beginning worry in him.

Cal spoke happily. “I’m going,” he said. “I’m going now. It’s all right. What Lee said was true.”
“What did Lee say?”
Cal said, “I was afraid I had you in me.”
“You have,” said Kate.
“No, I haven’t. I’m my own. I don’t have to be you.”
“How do you know that?” she demanded.
“I just know. It just came to me whole. If I’m mean, it’s my own mean.”
“This Chinaman has really fed you some pap. What are you looking at me like that for?”
Cal said, “I don’t think the light hurts your eyes. I think you’re afraid.”
“Get out!” she cried. “Go on, get out!”
“I’m going.” He had his hand on the doorknob. “I don’t hate you,” he said. “But I’m glad you’re
afraid.”
She tried to shout “Joe!” but her voice thickened to a croak.
Cal wrenched open the door and slammed it behind him.
Joe was talking to one of the girls in the parlor. They heard the stutter of light quick footsteps.
But by the time they looked up a streaking figure had reached the door, opened it, slipped
through, and the heavy front door banged. There was only one step on the porch and then a
crunch as jumping feet struck earth.
“What in hell was that?” the girl asked.
“God knows,” said Joe. “Sometimes I think I’m seeing things.”
“Me too,” said the girl. “Did I tell you Clara’s got bugs under her skin?”
“I guess she seen-the shadow of the needle,” said Joe. “Well, the way I figure, the less you know,
the better off you are.”
“That’s the truth you said there,” the girl agreed.

Chapter 40
1
Kate sat back in her chair against the deep down cushions. Waves of nerves cruised over her
body, rais-ing the little hairs and making ridges of icy burn as they went.
She spoke softly to herself. “Steady now,” she said. “Quiet down. Don’t let it hit you. Don’t think
for a while. The goddam snot-nose!”
She thought suddenly of the only person who had ever made her feel this panic hatred. It was
Samuel Hamilton, with his white beard and his pink cheeks and the laughing eyes that lifted her
skin and looked under-neath.
With her bandaged forefinger she dug out a slender chain which hung around her neck and pulled
the chain’s burden up from her bodice. On the chain were strung two safe-deposit keys, a gold
watch with a fleur-de-lis pin, and a little steel tube with a ring on its top. Very carefully she
unscrewed the top from the tube and, spreading her knees, shook out a gelatine capsule. She held
the capsule under the light and saw the white crystals inside—six grains of morphine, a good,
sure margin. Very gently she eased the capsule into its tube, screwed on the cap, and dropped the
chain inside her dress.
Cal’s last words had been repeating themselves over and over in her head. “I’m glad you’re
afraid.” She said the words aloud to herself to kill the sound. The rhythm stopped, but a strong
picture formed in her mind and she let it form so that she could inspect it again.

2
It was before the lean-to was built. Kate had collected the money Charles had left. The check was
converted to large bills, and the bills in their bales were in the safe-deposit box at the Monterey
County Bank.
It was about the time the first pains began to twist her hands. There was enough money now to go
away. It was just a matter of getting the most she could out of the house. But also it was better to
wait until she felt quite well again.
She never felt quite well again. New York seemed cold and very far away.
A letter came to her signed “Ethel.” Who in hell was Ethel? Whoever she was, she must be crazy
to ask for money. Ethel—there were hundreds of Ethels. Ethels grew on every bush. And this one
scrawled illegibly on a lined pad.
Not very long afterward Ethel came to see Kate, and Kate hardly recognized her.
Kate sat at her desk, watchful, suspicious, and con-fident. “It’s been a long time,” she said.
Ethel responded like a soldier who comes in his cushion age upon the sergeant who trained him.
“I’ve been poorly,” she said. Her flesh had thickened and grown heavy all over her. Her clothes
had the strained cleanliness that means poverty.

“Where are you—staying now?” Kate asked, and she wondered how soon the old bag would be
able to come to the point.
“Southern Pacific Hotel. I got a room.”
“Oh, then you don’t work in a house now?”
“I couldn’t never get started again,” said Ethel. “You shouldn’t of run me off.” She wiped big
tears from the corners of her eyes with the tip of a cotton glove. “Things are bad,” she said. “First
I had trouble when we got that new judge. Ninety days, and I didn’t have no record—not here
anyways. I come out of that and I got the old Joe. I didn’t know I had it. Give it to a regular—
nice fella, worked on the section gang. He got sore an’ busted me up, hurt my nose, lost four
teeth, an’ that new judge he give me a hundred and eighty. Hell, Kate, you lose all your contacts
in a hundred and eighty days. They forget you’re alive. I just never could get started.”
Kate nodded her head in cold and shallow sympathy. She knew that Ethel was working up to the
bite. Just before it came Kate made a move. She opened her desk drawer and took out some
money and held it out to Ethel. “I never let a friend down,” she said. “Why don’t you go to a new
town, start fresh? It might change your luck.”
Ethel tried to keep her fingers from grabbing at the money. She fanned the bills like a poker hand
—four tens. Her mouth began to work with emotion.
Ethel said, “I kind of hoped you’d see your way to let me take more than forty bucks.”
“What do you mean?”
“Didn’t you get my letter?”
“What letter?”
“Oh’“ said Ethel. “Well, maybe it got lost in the mail. They don’t take no care of things.
Anyways, I thought you might look after me. I don’t feel good hardly ever. Got a kind of weight
dragging my guts down.” She sighed and then she spoke so rapidly that Kate knew it had been
rehearsed.
“Well, maybe you remember how I’ve got like sec-ond sight,” Ethel began. “Always predicting
things that come true. Always dreaming stuff and it come out. Fella says I should go in the
business. Says I’m a natural medium. You remember that?”
“No,” said Kate, “I don’t.”
“Don’t? Well, maybe you never noticed. All the others did. I told ’em lots of things and they
come true.”
“What are you trying to say?”
“I had this-here dream. I remember when it was because it was the same night Faye died.” Her
eves flicked up at Kate’s cold face. She continued doggedly, “It rained that night, and it was
raining in my dream—anyways, it was wet. Well, in my dream I seen you come out the kitchen
door. It wasn’t pitch-dark—moon was coming through a little. And the dream thing was you.
You went out to the back of the lot and stooped over. I couldn’t see what you done. Then you
come creeping back.
“Next thing I knew—why, Faye was dead.” She paused and waited for some comment from Kate,
but Kate’s face was expressionless.

Ethel waited until she was sure Kate would not speak. “Well, like I said, I always believed in my
dreams. It’s funny, there wasn’t nothing out there ex-cept some smashed medicine bottles and a
little rubber tit from an eye-dropper.”
Kate said lazily, “So you took them to a doctor. What did he say had been in the bottles?”
“Oh, I didn’t do nothing like that.”
“You should have,” said Kate.
“I don’t want to see nobody get in trouble. I’ve had enough trouble myself. I put that broke glass
in an envelope and stuck it away.”
Kate said softly, “And so you are coming to me for advice?”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“I’ll tell you what I think,” said Kate. “I think you’re a worn-out old whore and you’ve been
beaten over the head too many times.”
“Don’t you start saying I’m nuts—” Ethel began.
“No, maybe you’re not, but you’re tired and you’re sick. I told you I never let a friend down. You
can come back here. You can’t work but you can help around, clean and give the cook a hand.
You’ll have a bed and you’ll get your meals. How would that be? And a little spending money.”
Ethel stirred uneasily. “No, ma’am,” she said. “I don’t think I want to—sleep here. I don’t carry
that envelope around. I left it with a friend.”
“What did you have in mind?” Kate asked.
“Well, I thought if you could see your way to let me have a hundred dollars a month, why, I
could make out and maybe get my health back.”
“You said you lived at the Southern Pacific Hotel?”
“Yes, ma’am—and my room is right up the hall from the desk. The night clerk’s a friend of mine.
He don’t never sleep when he’s on duty. Nice fella.”
Kate said, “Don’t wet your pants, Ethel. All you’ve got to worry about is how much does the
‘nice fella’ want. Now wait a minute.” She counted six more ten-dollar bills from the drawer in
front of her and held them out.
“Will it come the first of the month or do I have to come here for it?”
“I’ll send it to you,” said Kate. “And, Ethel,” she continued quietly, “I still think you ought to
have those bottles analyzed.”
Ethel clutched the money tightly in her hand. She was bubbling over with triumph and good
feeling. It was one of the few things that had ever worked out for her. “I wouldn’t think of doing
that,” she said. “Not unless I had to.”
After she had gone Kate strolled out to the back of the lot behind the house. And even after years
she could see from the unevenness of the earth that it must have been pretty thoroughly dug over.
The next morning the judge heard the usual chronicle of small violence and nocturnal greed. He
only half listened to the fourth case and at the end of the terse testimony of the complaining
witness he asked, “How much did you lose?”
The dark-haired man said, “Pretty close to a hun-dred dollars.”
The judge turned to the arresting officer. “How much did she have?”

“Ninety-six dollars. She got whisky and cigarettes and some magazines from the night clerk at
six o’clock this morning.”
Ethel cried, “I never seen this guy in my life.”
The judge looked up from his papers. “Twice for prostitution and now robbery. You’re costing
too much. I want you out of town by noon.” He turned to the officer. “Tell the sheriff to run her
over the county line.” And he said to Ethel, “If you come back, I’ll give you to the county for the
limit, and that’s San Quentin. Do you understand?”
Ethel said, “Judge, I want to see you alone.”
“Why?”
“I got to see you,” said Ethel. “This is a frame.”
“Everything’s a frame,” said the judge. “Next.”
While a deputy sheriff drove Ethel to the county line on the bridge over the Pajaro River, the
complaining witness strolled down Castroville Street toward Kate’s, changed his mind and went
back to Kenoe’s barbershop to get a hair cut.

3
Ethel’s visit did not disturb Kate very much when it happened. She knew about what attention
would be paid to a whore with a grievance, and that an analysis of the broken bottles would not
show anything recognizable as poison. She had nearly forgotten Faye. The forcible recalling was
simply an unpleasant memory.
Gradually, however, she found herself thinking about it. One night when she was checking the
items on a grocery bill a thought shot into her mind, shining and winking like a meteor. The
thought flashed and went out so quickly that she had to stop what she was doing to try to find it.
How was the dark face of Charles involved in the thought? And Sam Hamilton’s puzzled and
merry eyes? And why did she get a shiver of fear from the flashing thought?
She gave it up and went back to her work, but the face of Charles was behind her, looking over
her shoul-der. Her fingers began to hurt her. She put the accounts away and made a tour through
the house. It was a slow, listless night—a Tuesday night. There weren’t even enough customers
to put on the circus.
Kate knew how the girls felt about her. They were desperately afraid of her. She kept them that
way. It was probable that they hated her, and that didn’t mat-ter either. But they trusted her, and
that did matter. If they followed the rules she laid down, followed them exactly, Kate would take
care of them and protect them. There was no love involved and no respect. She never rewarded
them and she punished an offender only twice before she removed her. The girls did have the
security of knowing that they would not be pun-ished without cause.
As Kate walked about, the girls became elaborately casual. Kate knew about that too and
expected it. But on this night she felt that she was not alone. Charles seemed to walk to the side
and behind her.
She went through the dining room and into the kitch-en, opened the icebox and looked in. She
lifted the cover of the garbage can and inspected it for waste. She did this every night, but this

night she carried some extra charge.
When she had left the parlor the girls looked at each other and raised their shoulders in
bewilderment. Eloise, who was talking to the dark-haired Joe, said, “Anything the matter?”
“Not that I know of. Why?”
“I don’t know. She seems nervous.”
“Well, there was some kind of rat race.”
“What was it?”
“Wait a minute!” said Joe. “I don’t know and you don’t know.”
“I get it. Mind my own business.”
“You’re goddam right,” said Joe. “Let’s keep it that way, shall we?”
“I don’t want to know,” said Eloise.
“Now you’re talking,” Joe said.
Kate ranged back from her tour. “I’m going to bed,” she said to Joe. “Don’t call me unless you
have to.”
“Anything I can do?”
“Yes, make me a pot of tea. Did you press that dress, Eloise?”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“You didn’t do it very well.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
Kate was restless. She put all of her papers neatly in the pigeonholes of her desk, and when Joe
brought the tea tray she had him put it beside her bed.
Lying back among her pillows and sipping the tea, she probed for her thought. What about
Charles? And then it came to her.
Charles was clever. In his crazy way Sam Hamilton was clever. That was the fear-driven thought
—there were clever people. Both Sam and Charles were dead, but maybe there were others. She
worked it out very slowly.
Suppose I had been the one to dig up the bottles? What would I think and what would I do? A rim
of panic rose in her breast. Why were the bottles broken and buried? So it wasn’t a poison! Then
why bury them? What had made her do that? She should have dropped them in the gutter on
Main Street or tossed them in the garbage can. Dr. Wilde was dead. But what kind of records did
he keep? She didn’t know. Suppose she had found the glass and learned what had been in them.
Wouldn’t she have asked someone who knew—“Suppose you gave croton oil to a person. What
would happen?”
“Well, suppose you gave little doses and kept it up a long time?” She would know. Maybe
somebody else would know.
“Suppose you heard about a rich madam who willed everything to a new girl and then died.” Kate
knew perfectly well what her first thought would be. What insanity had made her get Ethel
floated? Now she couldn’t be found. Ethel should have been paid and tricked into turning over
the glass. Where was the glass now? In an envelope—but where? How could Ethel be found?
Ethel would know why and how she had been floated. Ethel wasn’t bright, but she might tell

some-body who was bright. That chattering voice might tell the story, how Faye was sick, and
what she looked like, and about the will.
Kate was breathing quickly and little prickles of fear were beginning to course over her body. She
should go to New York or someplace—not bother to sell the house. She didn’t need the money.
She had plenty. Nobody could find her. Yes, but if she ran out and the clever person heard Ethel
tell the story, wouldn’t that cinch it?
Kate got up from her bed and took a heavy dose of bromide.
From that time on the crouching fear had always been at her side. She was almost glad when she
learned that the pain in her hands was developing arthritis. An evil voice had whispered that it
might be a punishment.
She had never gone out in the town very much, but now she developed a reluctance to go out at
all. She knew that men stared secretly after her, knowing who she was. Suppose one of those men
should have Charles’ face or Samuel’s eyes. She had to drive herself to go out once a week.
Then she built the lean-to and had it painted gray. She said it was because the light troubled her
eyes, and gradually she began to believe the light did trouble her eyes. Her eyes burned after a
trip to the town. She spent more and more time in her little room.
It is possible to some people, and it was possible for Kate, to hold two opposing thoughts at the
same time. She believed that the light pained her eyes, and also that the gray room was a cave to
hide in, a dark burrow in the earth, a place where no eyes could stare at her. Once, sitting in her
pillowed chair, she considered having a secret door built so that she would have an avenue of
escape. And then a feeling rather than a thought threw out the plan. She would not be protect-ed
then. If she could get out, something could get in—that something which had begun to crouch
outside the house, to crawl close to the walls at night, and to rise silently, trying to look through
the windows. It required more and more will power for Kate to leave the house on Monday
afternoons.
When Cal began to follow her she had a terrible leap of fear. And when she waited for him
behind the privet she was very near to panic.
But now her head dug deep in her soft pillows and her eyes felt the gentle weight of the bromide.

The nation slid imperceptibly toward war, frightened and at the same time attracted. People had
not felt the shaking emotion of war in nearly sixty years. The Spanish affair was more nearly an
expedition than a war. Mr. Wilson was re-elected President in November on his platform promise
to keep us out of war, and at the same time he was instructed to take a firm hand, which
inevitably meant war. Business picked up and prices began to rise. British purchasing agents
roved about the country, buying food and cloth and metals and chemicals. A charge of excitement
ran through the country. People didn’t really believe in war even while they planned it. The
Salinas Valley lived about as it always had.

Cal walked to school with Aron.
“You look tired,” Aron said.
“Do I?”
“I heard you come in last night. Four o’clock. What do you do so late?”
“I was walking around—thinking. How would you like to quit school and go back to the ranch?”
“What for?”
“We could make some money for Father.”
“I’m going to college. I wish I could go now. Everybody is laughing at us. I want to get out of
town.”
“You act mad.”
“I’m not mad. But I didn’t lose the money. I didn’t have a crazy lettuce idea. But people laugh at
me just the same. And I don’t know if there’s enough money for college.”
“He didn’t mean to lose the money.”
“But he lost it.”
Cal said, “You’ve got this year to finish and next before you can go to college.”
“Do you think I don’t know it?”
“If you worked hard, maybe you could take entrance examinations next summer and go in the
fall.”
Aron swung around. “I couldn’t do it.”
“I think you could. Why don’t you talk to the princi-pal? And I bet the Reverend Rolf would help
you.”
Aron said, “I want to get out of this town. I don’t ever want to come back. They still call us
Lettuce-heads. They laugh at us.”
“How about Abra?”

“Abra will do what’s best.”
Cal asked, “Would she want you to go away?”
“Abra’s going to do what I want her to do.”
Cal thought for a moment. “I’ll tell you what. I’m going to try to make some money. If you
knuckle down and pass examinations a year early, why, I’ll help you through college.”
“You will?”
“Sure I will.”
“Why, I’ll go and see the principal right away.” He quickened his steps.
Cal called, “Aron, wait! Listen! If he says he thinks you can do it, don’t tell Father.”
“Why not?”
“I was just thinking how nice it would be if you went to him and told him you’d done it.”
“I don’t see what difference it makes.”
“You don’t?”
“No, I don’t,” said Aron. “It sounds silly to me.”
Cal had a violent urge to shout, “I know who our mother is! I can show her to you.” That would
cut through and get inside of Aron.
Cal met Abra in the hall before the schoolbell rang.
“What’s the matter with Aron?” he demanded.
“I don’t know.”
“Yes, you do,” he said.
“He’s just in a cloud. I think it’s that minister.”
“Does he walk home with you?”
“Sure he does. But I can see right through him. He’s wearing wings.”
“He’s still ashamed about the lettuce.”
“I know he is,” said Abra. “I try to talk him out of it. Maybe he’s enjoying it.”
“What do you mean?”
“Nothing,” said Abra.
After supper that night Cal said, “Father, would you mind if I went down to the ranch Friday
afternoon?”
Adam turned in his chair. “What for?”
“Just want to see. Just want to look around.”
“Does Aron want to go?”
“No. I want to go alone.”
“I don’t see why you shouldn’t. Lee, do you see any reason why he shouldn’t go?”
“No,” said Lee. He studied Cal. “Thinking seriously of going to farming?”
“I might. If you’d let me take it over, I’d farm it, Father.”
“The lease has more than a year to run,” Adam said.
“After that can I farm it?”
“How about school?”
“I’ll be through school.”

“Well, we’ll see,” said Adam. “You might want to go to college.”
When Cal started for the front door Lee followed and walked out with him.
“Can you tell me what it’s about?” Lee asked.
“I just want to look around.”
“All right, I guess I’m left out.” Lee turned to go back into the house. Then he called, “Cal!” The
boy stopped. “You worried, Cal?”
“No.”
“I’ve got five thousand dollars if you ever need it.”
“Why would I need it?”
“I don’t know,” said Lee.

Will Hamilton liked his glass cage of an office in the garage. His business interests were much
wider than the automobile agency, but he did not get another office. He loved the movement that
went on outside his square glass cage. And he had put in double glass to kill the noise of the
garage.
He sat in his big red leather swivel chair, and most of the time he enjoyed his life. When people
spoke of his brother Joe making so much money in advertising in the East, Will always said he
himself was a big frog in a little puddle.
“I’d be afraid to go to a big city,” he said. “I’m just a country boy.” And he liked the laugh that
always fol-lowed. It proved to him that his friends knew he was well off.
Cal came in to see him one Saturday morning. Seeing Will’s puzzled look, he said, “I’m Cal
Trask.”
“Oh, sure. Lord, you’re getting to be a big boy. Is your father down?”
“No. I came alone.”
“Well, sit down. I don’t suppose you smoke.”
“Sometimes. Cigarettes.”
Will slid a package of Murads across the desk. Cal opened the box and then closed it. “I don’t
think I will right now.”
Will looked at the dark-faced boy and he liked him. He thought, This boy is sharp. He’s nobody’s
fool. “I guess you’ll be going into business pretty soon,” he said.
“Yes, sir. I thought I might run the ranch when I get out of high school.”
“There’s no money in that,” said Will. “Farmers don’t make any money. It’s the man who buys
from him and sells. You’ll never make any money farming.” Will knew that Cal was feeling him,
testing him, observ-ing him, and he approved of that.
And Cal had made up his mind, but first he asked, “Mr. Hamilton, you haven’t any children, have
you?”
“Well, no. And I’m sorry about that. I guess I’m sorriest about that.” And then, “What makes you
ask?”
Cal ignored the question. “Would you give me some advice?”

Will felt a glow of pleasure. “If I can, I’ll be glad to. What is it you want to know?”
And then Cal did something Will Hamilton approved even more. He used candor as a weapon.
He said, “I want to make a lot of money. I want you to tell me how.”
Will overcame his impulse to laugh. Naïve as the statement was, he didn’t think Cal was naïve.
“Every-body wants that,” he said. “What do you mean by a lot of money?”
“Twenty or thirty thousand dollars.”
“Good God!” said Will, and he screeched his chair forward. And now he did laugh, but not in
derision. Cal smiled along with Will’s laughter.
Will said, “Can you tell me why you want to make so much?”
“Yes, sir,” said Cal, “I can.” And Cal opened the box of Murads and took out one of the oval
cork-tipped cigarettes and lighted it. “I’ll tell you why,” he said.
Will leaned his chair back in enjoyment.
“My father lost a lot of money.”
“I know,” said Will. “I warned him not to try to ship lettuce across the country.”
“You did? Why did you?”
“There were no guarantees,” said Will. “A business-man has to protect himself. If anything
happened, he was finished. And it happened. Go on.”
“I want to make enough money to give him back what he lost.”
Will gaped at him. “Why?” he asked.
“I want to.”
Will said, “Are you fond of him?”
“Yes.”
Will’s fleshy face contorted and a memory swept over him like a chilling wind. He did not move
slowly over the past, it was all there in one flash, all of the years, a picture, a feeling and a
despair, all stopped the way a fast camera stops the world. There was the flashing Samuel,
beautiful as dawn with a fancy like a swallow’s flight, and the brilliant, brooding Tom who was
dark fire, Una who rode the storms, and the lovely Mollie, Dessie of laughter, George handsome
and with a sweet-ness that filled a room like the perfume of flowers, and there was Joe, the
youngest, the beloved. Each one without effort brought some gift into the family.
Nearly everyone has his box of secret pain, shared with no one. Will had concealed his well,
laughed loud, exploited perverse virtues, and never let his jealousy go wandering. He thought of
himself as slow, doltish, con-servative, uninspired. No great dream lifted him high and no despair
forced self-destruction. He was always on the edge, trying to hold on to the rim of the family with
what gifts he had—care, and reason, application. He kept the books, hired the attorneys, called
the under-taker, and eventually paid the bills. The others didn’t even know they needed him. He
had the ability to get money and to keep it. He thought the Hamiltons despised him for his one
ability. He had loved them doggedly, had always been at hand with his money to pull them out of
their errors. He thought they were ashamed of him, and he fought bitterly for their recog-nition.
All of this was in the frozen wind that blew through him.
His slightly bulging eyes were damp as he stared past Cal, and the boy asked, “What’s the matter,

Mr. Ham-ilton? Don’t you feel well?”
Will had sensed his family but he had not under-stood them. And they had accepted him without
know-ing there was anything to understand. And now this boy came along. Will understood him,
felt him, sensed him, recognized him. This was the son he should have had, or the brother, or the
father. And the cold wind of memory changed to a warmth toward Cal which gripped him in the
stomach and pushed up against his lungs.
He forced his attention to the glass office. Cal was sitting back in his chair, waiting.
Will did not know how long his silence had lasted. “I was thinking,” he said lamely. He made his
voice stern. “You asked me something. I’m a businessman. I don’t give things away. I sell them.”
“Yes, sir.” Cal was watchful but he felt that Will Hamilton liked him.
Will said, “I want to know something and I want the truth. Will you tell me the truth?”
“I don’t know,” said Cal.
“I like that. How do you know until you know the question? I like that. That’s smart—and
honest. Listen—you have a brother. Does your father like him better than you?”
“Everybody does,” said Cal calmly. “Everybody loves Aron.”
“Do you?”
“Yes, sir. At least—yes, I do.”
“What’s the ‘at least’?”
“Sometimes I think he’s stupid but I like him.”
“Now how about your father?”
“I love him,” said Cal.
“And he loves your brother better.”
“I don’t know.”
“Now, you say you want to give back the money your father lost. Why?”
Ordinarily Cal’s eyes were squinted and cautious, but now they were so wide that they seemed to
look around and through Will. Cal was as close to his own soul as it is possible to get.
“My father is good,” he said. “I want to make it up to him because I am not good.”
“If you do that, wouldn’t you be good?”
“No,” said Cal. “I think bad.”
Will had never met anyone who spoke so nakedly. He was near to embarrassment because of the
naked-ness, and he knew how safe Cal was in his stripped honesty. “Only one more,” he said,
“and I won’t mind if you don’t answer it. I don’t think I would answer it. Here it is. Suppose you
should get this money and give it to your father—would it cross your mind that you were trying
to buy his love?”
“Yes, sir. It would. And it would be true.”
“That’s all I want to ask. That’s all.” Will leaned forward and put his hands against his sweating,
pulsing forehead. He could not remember when he had been so shaken. And in Cal there was a
cautious leap of triumph. He knew he had won and he closed his face against showing it.
Will raised his head and took off his glasses and wiped the moisture from them. “Let’s go
outside,” he said. “Let’s go for a drive.”

Will drove a big Winton now, with a hood as long as a coffin and a powerful, panting mutter in
its bowels. He drove south from King City over the county road, through the gathering forces of
spring, and the meadowlarks flew ahead, bubbling melody from the fence wires. Pico Blanco
stood up against the West with a full head of snow, and in the valley the lines of eucalyptus,
which stretched across the valley to break the winds, were gleaming silver with new leaves.
When he came to the side road that led into the home draw of the Trask place Will pulled up on
the side of the road. He had not spoken since the Winton rolled out of King City. The big motor
idled with a deep whisper.
Will, looking straight ahead, said, “Cal—do you want to be partners with me?”
“Yes, sir.”
“I don’t like to take a partner without money. I could lend you the money, but there’s only
trouble in that.”
“I can get money,” said Cal.
“How much?”
“Five thousand dollars.”
“You—I don’t believe it.”
Cal didn’t answer.
“I believe it,” said Will. “Borrowed?”
“Yes, sir.”
“What interest?”
“None.”
“That’s a good trick. Where will you get it?”
“I won’t tell you, sir.”
Will shook his head and laughed. He was filled with pleasure. “Maybe I’m being a fool, but I
believe you—and I’m not a fool.” He gunned his motor and then let it idle again. “I want you to
listen. Do you read the papers?”
“Yes, sir.”
“We’re going to be in this war any minute now.”
“That’s what it looks like.”
“Well, a lot of people think so. Now, do you know the present price of beans? I mean, what can
you sell a hundred sacks for in Salinas?”
“I’m not sure. I think about three to three and a half cents a pound.”
“What do you mean you’re not sure? How do you know that?”
“Well, I was thinking about asking my father to let me run the ranch.”
“I see. But you don’t want to farm. You’re too smart. Your father’s tenant is named Rantani. He’s
a Swiss Italian, a good farmer. He’s put nearly five hundred acres under cultivation. If we can
guarantee him five cents a pound and give him a seed loan, he’ll plant beans. So will every other
farmer around here. We could contract five thousand acres of beans.”
Cal said, “What are we going to do with five-cent beans in a three-cent market? Oh, yes! But how
can we be sure?”

Will said, “Are we partners?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Yes, Will!”
“Yes, Will.”
“How soon can you get five thousand dollars?”
“By next Wednesday.”
“Shake!” Solemnly the stout man and the lean dark boy shook hands.
Will, still holding Cal’s hand, said, “Now we’re part-ners. I have a contract with the British
Purchasing Agency. And I have a friend in the Quartermaster Corps. I bet we can sell all the dried
beans we can find at ten cents a pound or more.”
“When can you sell?”
“I’ll sell before we sign anything. Now, would you like to go up to the old place and talk to
Rantani?”
“Yes sir,” said Cal.
Will double-clutched the Winton and the big green car lumbered into the side road.

Chapter 42
A war comes always to someone else. In Salinas we were aware that the United States was the
greatest and most powerful nation in the world. Every American was a rifleman by birth, and one
American was worth ten or twenty foreigners in a fight.
Pershing’s expedition into Mexico after Villa had exploded one of our myths for a little while.
We had truly believed that Mexicans can’t shoot straight and besides were lazy and stupid. When
our own Troop C came wearily back from the border they said that none of this was true.
Mexicans could shoot straight, goddam it! And Villa’s horsemen had outridden and outlasted our
town boys. The two evenings a month of training had not toughened them very much. And last,
the Mexicans seemed to have outthought and outambushed Black Jack Pershing. When the
Mexicans were joined by their ally, dysentery, it was godawful. Some of our boys didn’t really
feel good again for years.
Somehow we didn’t connect Germans with Mex-icans. We went right back to our myths. One
American was as good as twenty Germans. This being true, we had only to act in a stern manner
to bring the Kaiser to heel. He wouldn’t dare interfere with our trade—but he did. He wouldn’t
stick out his neck and sink our ships—and he did. It was stupid, but he did, and so there was
nothing for it but to fight him.
The war, at first anyway, was for other people. We, I, my family and friends, had kind of bleacher
seats, and it was pretty exciting. And just as war is always for somebody else, so it is also true
that someone else always gets killed. And Mother of God! that wasn’t true either. The dreadful
telegrams began to sneak sorrow-fully in, and it was everybody’s brother. Here we were, over six
thousand miles from the anger and the noise, and that didn’t save us.
It wasn’t much fun then. The Liberty Belles could parade in white caps and uniforms of white
sharkskin. Our uncle could rewrite his Fourth of July speech and use it to sell bonds. We in high
school could wear olive drab and campaign hats and learn the manual of arms from the physics
teacher, but Jesus Christ! Marty Hopps dead, the Berges boy, from across the street, the
handsome one our little sister was in love with from the time she was three, blown to bits!
And the gangling, shuffling loose-jointed boys carry-ing suitcases were marching awkwardly
down Main Street to the Southern Pacific Depot. They were sheep-ish, and the Salinas Band
marched ahead of them, playing the “Stars and Stripes Forever,” and the families walking along
beside them were crying, and the music sounded like a dirge. The draftees wouldn’t look at their
mothers. They didn’t dare. We’d never thought the war could happen to us.
There were some in Salinas who began to talk softly in the poolrooms and the bars. These had
private in-formation from a soldier—we weren’t getting the truth. Our men were being sent in
without guns. Troopships were sunk and the government wouldn’t tell us. The German army was
so far superior to ours that we didn’t have a chance. That Kaiser was a smart fellow. He was

getting ready to invade America. But would Wilson tell us this? He would not. And usually these
carrion talkers were the same ones who had said one American was worth twenty Germans in a
scrap—the same ones.
Little groups of British in their outlandish uniforms (but they did look smart) moved about the
country, buying everything that wasn’t nailed down and paying for it and paying big. A good
many of the British purchasing men were crippled, but they wore their uniforms just the same.
Among other things they bought beans, because beans are easy to transport and they don’t spoil
and a man can damn well live on them. Beans were twelve and a half cents a pound and hard to
find. And farmers wished they hadn’t contracted their beans for a lousy two cents a pound above
the going price six months ago.
The nation and the Salinas Valley changed its songs. At first we sang of how we would knock the
hell out of Helgoland and hang the Kaiser and march over there and clean up the mess them damn
foreigners had made. And then suddenly we sang, “In the war’s red curse stands the Red Cross
nurse. She’s the rose of No Man’s Land,” and we sang, “Hello, central, give me Heaven, ’cause
my Daddy’s there,” and we sang, “Just a baby’s prayer at twilight, when lights are low. She
climbs up-stairs and says her prayers—Oh, God! please tell my daddy thaddy must take care—” I
guess we were like a tough but inexperienced little boy who gets punched in the nose in the first
flurry and it hurts and we wished it was over.

Chapter 43

Late in the summer Lee came in off the street, carrying his big market basket. Lee had become
American con-servative in his clothes since he had lived in Salinas. He regularly wore black
broadcloth when he went out of the house. His shirts were white, his collars high and stiff, and he
affected narrow black string ties, like those which once were the badge for Southern senators. His
hats were black, round of crown and straight of brim, and uncrushed as though he still left room
for a coiled queue. He was immaculate.
Once Adam had remarked on the quiet splendor of Lee’s clothes, and Lee had grinned at him. “I
have to do it,” he said. “One must be very rich to dress as badly as you do. The poor are forced to
dress well.”
“Poor!” Adam exploded. “You’ll be lending us mon-ey before we’re through.”
“That might be,” said Lee.
This afternoon he set his heavy basket on the floor. “I’m going to try to make a winter melon
soup,” he said. “Chinese cooking. I have a cousin in Chinatown, and he told me how. My cousin
is in the firecracker and fan-tan business.”
“I thought you didn’t have any relatives,” said Adam.
“All Chinese are related, and the ones named Lee are closest,” said Lee. “My cousin is a Suey
Dong. Recently he went into hiding for his health and he learned to cook. You stand the melon in
a pot, cut off the top carefully, put in a whole chicken, mushrooms, water chestnuts, leeks, and
just a touch of ginger. Then you put the top back on the melon and cook it as slowly as possible
for two days. Ought to be good.”
Adam was lying back in his chair, his palms clasped behind his head, and he was smiling at the
ceiling. “Good, Lee, good,” he said.
“You didn’t even listen,” said Lee.
Adam drew himself upright. He said, “You think you know your own children and then you find
you don’t at all.”
Lee smiled. “Has some detail of their lives escaped you?” he asked.
Adam chuckled. “I only found out by accident,” he said. “I knew that Aron wasn’t around very
much this summer, but I thought he was just out playing.”
“Playing!” said Lee. “He hasn’t played for years.”
“Well, whatever he does.” Adam continued, “Today I met Mr. Kilkenny—you know, from the
high school? He thought I knew all about it. Do you know what that boy is doing?”
“No,” said Lee.
“He’s covered all next year’s work. He’s going to take examinations for college and save a year.

And Kilkenny is confident that he will pass. Now, what do you think of that?”
“Remarkable,” said Lee. “Why is he doing it?”
“Why, to save a year!”
“What does he want to save it for?”
“Goddam it, Lee, he’s ambitious. Can’t you under-stand that?”
“No,” said Lee. “I never could.”
Adam said, “He never spoke of it. I wonder if his brother knows.”
“I guess Aron wants it to be a surprise. We shouldn’t mention it until he does.”
“I guess you’re right. Do you know, Lee?—I’m proud of him. Terribly proud. This makes me feel
good. I wish Cal had some ambition.”
“Maybe he has,” said Lee. “Maybe he has some kind of a secret too.”
“Maybe. God knows we haven’t seen much of him lately either. Do you think it’s good for him to
be away so much?”
“Cal’s trying to find himself,” said Lee. “I guess this personal hide-and-seek is not unusual. And
some peo-ple are ‘it’ all their lives—hopelessly ‘it’.”
“Just think,” said Adam. “A whole year’s work ahead. When he tells us we ought to have a
present for him.”
“A gold watch,” said Lee.
“That’s right,” said Adam. “I’m going to get one and have it engraved and ready. What should it
say?”
“The jeweler will tell you,” said Lee. “You take the chicken out after two days and cut it off the
bone and put the meat back.”
“What chicken?”
“Winter melon soup,” said Lee.
“Have we got money enough to send him to college, Lee?”
“If we’re careful and he doesn’t develop expensive tastes.”
“He wouldn’t,” Adam said.
“I didn’t think I would—but I have.” Lee inspected the sleeve of his coat with admiration.

The rectory of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church was large and rambling. It had been built for ministers
with large families. Mr. Rolf, unmarried and simple in his tastes, closed up most of the house, but
when Aron needed a place to study he gave him a large room and helped him with his studies.
Mr. Rolf was fond of Aron. He liked the angelic beauty of his face and his smooth cheeks, his
narrow hips, and long straight legs. He liked to sit in the room and watch Aron’s face straining
with effort to learn. He understood why Aron could not work at home in an atmosphere not
conducive to hard clean thought. Mr. Rolf felt that Aron was his product, his spiritual son, his
contribution to the church. He saw him through his travail of celibacy and felt that he was
guiding him into calm waters.
Their discussions were long and close and personal. “I know I am criticized,” Mr. Rolf said. “I

happen to believe in a higher church than some people. No one can tell me that confession is not
just as important a sacrament as communion. And you mind my word—I am going to bring it
back, but cautiously, gradually.”
“When I have a church I’ll do it too.”
“It requires great tact,” said Mr. Rolf.
Aron said, “I wish we had in our church, well—well, I might as well say it. I wish we had
something like the Augustines or the Franciscans. Someplace to withdraw. Sometimes I feel
dirty. I want to get away from the dirt and be clean.”
“I know how you feel,” Mr. Rolf said earnestly. “But there I cannot go along with you. I can’t
think that our Lord Jesus would want his priesthood with-drawn from service to the world. Think
how he insisted that we preach the Gospel, help the sick and poor, even lower ourselves into filth
to raise sinners from the slime. We must keep the exactness of His example always before us.”
His eyes began to glow and his voice took on the throatiness he used in sermons. “Perhaps I
shouldn’t tell you this. And I hope you won’t find any pride in me in telling it. But there is a kind
of glory in it. For the last five weeks a woman has been coming to evening service. I don’t think
you can see her from the choir. She sits always in the last row on the left-hand side—yes, you can
see her too. She is off at an angle. Yes, you can see her. She wears a veil and she always leaves
before I can get back after recessional.”
“Who is she?” Aron asked.
“Well, you’ll have to learn these things. I made very discreet inquiries and you would never
guess. She is the—well—the owner of a house of ill fame.”
“Here in Salinas?”
“Here in Salinas.” Mr. Rolf leaned forward. “Aron, I can see your revulsion. You must get over
that. Don’t forget our Lord and Mary Magdalene. Without pride I say I would be glad to raise her
up.”
“What does she want here?” Aron demanded.
“Perhaps what we have to offer—salvation. It will require great tact. I can see how it will be. And
mark my words—these people are timid. One day there will come a tap on my door and she will
beg to come in. Then, Aron, I pray that I may be wise and patient. You must believe me—when
that happens, when a lost soul seeks the light, it is the highest and most beautiful experience a
priest can have. That’s what we are for, Aron. That’s what we are for.”
Mr. Rolf controlled his breathing with difficulty. “I pray God I may not fail,” he said.

Adam Trask thought of the war in terms of his own now dimly remembered campaign against the
Indians. No one knew anything about huge and general war. Lee read European history, trying to
discern from the filaments of the past some pattern of the future.
Liza Hamilton died with a pinched little smile on her mouth, and her cheekbones were
shockingly high when the red was gone from them.
And Adam waited impatiently for Aron to bring news of his examinations. The massive gold

watch lay under his handkerchiefs in the top drawer of his bu-reau, and he kept it wound and set
and checked its accuracy against his own watch.
Lee had his instructions. On the evening of the day of the announcement he was to cook a turkey
and bake a cake.
“We’ll want to make a party of it,” Adam said. “What would you think of champagne?”
“Very nice,” said Lee. “Did you ever read von Clausewitz?”
“Who is he?”
“Not very reassuring reading,” said Lee. “One bottle of champagne?”
“That’s enough. It’s just for toasts, you know. Makes a party of it.” It didn’t occur to Adam that
Aron might fail.
One afternoon Aron came in and asked Lee, “Where’s father?”
“He’s shaving.”
“I won’t be in for dinner,” said Aron. In the bathroom he stood behind his father and spoke to the
soap-faced image in the mirror. “Mr. Rolf asked me to have dinner at the rectory.”
Adam wiped his razor on a folded piece of toilet paper. “That’s nice,” he said.
“Can I get a bath?”
“I’ll be out of here in just a minute,” said Adam.
When Aron walked through the living room and said good night and went out, Cal and Adam
looked after him. “He got into my cologne,” said Cal. “I can still smell him.”
“It must be quite a party,” Adam said.
“I don’t blame him for wanting to celebrate. That was a hard job.”
“Celebrate?”
“The exams. Didn’t he tell you? He passed them.”
“Oh, yes—the exams,” said Adam. “Yes, he told me. A fine job. I’m proud of him. I think I’ll get
him a gold watch.”
Cal said sharply, “He didn’t tell you!”
“Oh, yes—yes, he did. He told me this morning.”
“He didn’t know this morning,” said Cal, and he got up and went out.
He walked very fast in the gathering darkness, out Central Avenue, past the park and past
Stonewall Jack-son Smart’s house clear to the place beyond the street-lights where the street
became a county road and angled to avoid Tollot’s farm house.
At ten o’clock Lee, going out to mail a letter, found Cal sitting on the lowest step of the front
porch. “What happened to you?” he asked.
“I went for a walk.”
“What’s the matter with Aron?”
“I don’t know.”
“He seems to have some kind of grudge. Want to walk to the post office with me?”
“No.”
“What are you sitting out here for?”
“I’m going to beat the hell out of him.”

“Don’t do it,” said Lee.
“Why not?”
“Because I don’t think you can. He’d slaughter you.”
“I guess you’re right,” said Cal. “The son of a bitch!”
“Watch your language.”
Cal laughed. “I guess I’ll walk along with you.”
“Did you ever read von Clausewitz?”
“I never even heard of him.”
When Aron came home it was Lee who was waiting for him on the lowest step of the front porch.
“I saved you from a licking,” Lee said. “Sit down.”
“I’m going to bed.”
“Sit down! I want to talk to you. Why didn’t you tell your father you passed the tests?”
“He wouldn’t understand.”
“You’ve got a bug up your ass.”
“I don’t like that kind of language.”
“Why do you think I used it? I am not profane by accident. Aron, your father has been living for
this.”
“How did he know about it?”
“You should have told him yourself.”
“This is none of your business.”
“I want you to go in and wake him up if he’s asleep, but I don’t think he’ll be asleep. I want you
to tell him.”
“I won’t do it.”
Lee said softly, “Aron, did you ever have to fight a little man, a man half your size?”
“What do you mean?”
“It’s one of the most embarrassing things in the world. He won’t stop and pretty soon you have to
hit him and that’s worse. Then you’re really in trouble all around.”
“What are you talking about?”
“If you don’t do as I tell you, Aron, I’m going to fight you. Isn’t that ridiculous?”
Aron tried to pass. Lee stood up in front of him, his tiny fists doubled ineffectually, his stance and
position so silly that he began to laugh. “I don’t know how to do it, but I’m going to try,” he said.
Aron nervously backed away from him. And when finally he sat down on the steps Lee sighed
deeply. “Thank heaven that’s over,” he said. “It would have been awful. Look, Aron, can’t you
tell me what’s the matter with you? You always used to tell me.”
Suddenly Aron broke down. “I want to go away. It’s a dirty town.”
“No, it isn’t. It’s just the same as other places.”
“I don’t belong here. I wish we hadn’t ever come here. I don’t know what’s the matter with me. I
want to go away.” His voice rose to a wail.
Lee put his arm around the broad shoulders to com-fort him. “You’re growing up. Maybe that’s
it,” he said softly. “Sometimes I think the world tests us most sharply then, and we turn inward

and watch ourselves with horror. But that’s not the worst. We think every-body is seeing into us.
Then dirt is very dirty and purity is shining white. Aron, it will be over. Wait only a little while
and it will be over. That’s not much relief to you because you don’t believe it, but it’s the best I
can do for you. Try to believe that things are neither so good nor so bad as they seem to you now.
Yes, I can help you. Go to bed now, and in the morning get up early and tell your father about the
tests. Make it exciting. He’s lonelier than you are because he has no lovely future to dream about.
Go through the motions. Sam Hamilton said that. Pretend it’s true and maybe it will be. Go
through the motions. Do that. And go to bed. I’ve got to bake a cake—for breakfast. And, Aron—
your father left a present on your pillow.”

Chapter 44
1
It was only after Aron went away to college that Abra really got to know his family. Aron and
Abra had fenced themselves in with themselves. With Aron gone, she attached herself to the
other Trasks. She found that she trusted Adam more, and loved Lee more, than her own father.
About Cal she couldn’t decide. He disturbed her sometimes with anger, sometimes with pain, and
some-times with curiosity. He seemed to be in a perpetual contest with her. She didn’t know
whether he liked her or not, and so she didn’t like him. She was relieved when, calling at the
Trask house, Cal was not there, to look secretly at her, judge, appraise, consider, and look away
when she caught him at it.
Abra was a straight, strong, fine-breasted woman, developed and ready and waiting to take her
sacrament—but waiting. She took to going to the Trask house after school, sitting with Lee,
reading him parts of Aron’s daily letter.
Aron was lonely at Stanford. His letters were drenched with lonesome longing for his girl.
Together they were matter of fact, but from the university, ninety miles away, he made passionate
love to her, shut him-self off from the life around him. He studied, ate, slept, and wrote to Abra,
and this was his whole life.
In the afternoons she sat in the kitchen with Lee and helped him to string beans or slip peas from
their pods. Sometimes she made fudge and very often she stayed to dinner rather than go home to
her parents. There was no subject she could not discuss with Lee. And the few things she could
talk about to her father and mother were thin and pale and tired and mostly not even true. There
Lee was different also. Abra wanted to tell Lee only true things even when she wasn’t quite sure
what was true.
Lee would sit smiling a little, and his quick fragile hands flew about their work as though they
had inde-pendent lives. Abra wasn’t aware that she spoke exclu-sively of herself. And sometimes
while she talked Lee’s mind wandered out and came back and went out again like a ranging dog,
and Lee would nod at intervals and make a quiet humming sound.
He liked Abra and he felt strength and goodness in her, and warmth too. Her features had the bold
muscu-lar strength which could result finally either in ugliness or in great beauty. Lee, musing
through her talk, thought of the round smooth faces of the Cantonese, his own breed. Even thin
they were moon-faced. Lee should have liked that kind best since beauty must be somewhat like
ourselves, but he didn’t. When he thought of Chinese beauty the iron predatory faces of the
Manchus came to his mind, arrogant and unyield-ing faces of a people who had authority by
unques-tioned inheritance.
She said, “Maybe it was there all along. I don’t know. He never talked much about his father. It

was after Mr. Trask had the—you know—the lettuce. Aron was angry then.”
“Why?” Lee asked.
“People were laughing at him.”
Lee’s whole mind popped back. “Laughing at Aron? Why at him? He didn’t have anything to do
with it.”
“Well, that’s the way he felt. Do you want to know what I think?”
“Of course,” said Lee.
“I figured this out and I’m not quite finished figur-ing. I thought he always felt—well, kind of
crippled—-maybe unfinished, because he didn’t have a mother.”
Lee’s eyes opened wide and then drooped again. He nodded. “I see. Do you figure Cal is that way
too?”
“No.”
“Then why Aron?”
“Well, I haven’t got that yet. Maybe some people need things more than others, or hate things
more. My father hates turnips. He always did. Never came from anything. Turnips make him
mad, real mad. Well, one time my mother was—well, huffy, and she made a cas-serole of mashed
turnips with lots of pepper and cheese on top and got it all brown on top. My father ate half a dish
of it before he asked what it was. My mother said turnips, and he threw the dish on the floor and
got up and went out. I don’t think he ever forgave her.”
Lee chuckled. “He can forgive her because she said turnips. But, Abra, suppose he’d asked and
she had said something else and he liked it and had another dish. And then afterward he found
out. Why, he might have murdered her.”
“I guess so. Well, anyway, I figure Aron needed a mother more than Cal did. And I think he
always blamed his father.”
“Why?”
“I don’t know. That’s what I think.”
“You do get around, don’t you?”
“Shouldn’t I?”
“Of course you should.”
“Shall I make some fudge?”
“Not today. We still have some.”
“What can I do?”
“You can pound flour into the top round. Will you eat with us?”
“No. I’m going to a birthday party, thank you. Do you think he’ll be a minister?”
“How do I know?” said Lee. “Maybe it’s just an idea.”
“I hope he doesn’t,” said Abra, and she clapped her mouth shut in astonishment at having said it.
Lee got up and pulled out the pastry board and laid out the red meat and a flour sifter beside it.
“Use the back side of the knife,” he said.
“I know.” She hoped he hadn’t heard her.
But Lee asked, “Why don’t you want him to be a minister?”

“I shouldn’t say it.”
“You should say anything you want to. You don’t have to explain.” He went back to his chair,
and Abra sifted flour over the steak and pounded the meat with a big knife. Tap-tap—”I shouldn’t
talk like this”—tap-tap.
Lee turned his head away to let her take her own pace.
“He goes all one way,” she said over the pounding. “If it’s church it’s got to be high church. He
was talking about how priests shouldn’t be married.”
“That’s not the way his last letter sounded,” Lee observed.
“I know. That was before.” Her knife stopped its pounding. Her face was young perplexed pain.
“Lee, I’m not good enough for him.”
“Now, what do you mean by that?”
“I’m not being funny. He doesn’t think about me. He’s made someone up, and it’s like he put my
skin on her. I’m not like that—not like the made-up one.”
“What’s she like?”
“Pure!” said Abra. “Just absolutely pure. Nothing but pure—never a bad thing. I’m not like that.”
“Nobody is,” said Lee.
“He doesn’t know me. He doesn’t even want to know me. He wants that—white—ghost.”
Lee rubbed a piece of cracker. “Don’t you like him? You’re pretty young, but I don’t think that
makes any difference.”
“ ’Course I like him. I’m going to be his wife. But I want him to like me too. And how can he, if
he doesn’t know anything about me? I used to think he knew me. Now I’m not sure he ever did.”
“Maybe he’s going through a hard time that isn’t permanent. You’re a smart girl—very smart. Is
it pretty hard trying to live up to the one—in your skin?”
“I’m always afraid he’ll see something in me that isn’t in the one he made up. I’ll get mad or I’ll
smell bad—or something else. He’ll find out.”
“Maybe not,” said Lee. “But it must be hard living the Lily Maid, the Goddess-Virgin, and the
other all at once. Humans just do smell bad sometimes.”
She moved toward the table. “Lee, I wish—”
“Don’t spill flour on my floor,” he said. “What do you wish?”
“It’s from my figuring out. I think Aron, when he didn’t have a mother—why, he made her
everything good he could think of.”
“That might be. And then you think he dumped it all on you.” She stared at him and her fingers
wandered delicately up and down the blade of the knife. “And you wish you could find some way
to dump it all back.”
“Yes.”
“Suppose he wouldn’t like you then?”
“I’d rather take a chance on that,” she said. “I’d rather be myself.”
Lee said, “I never saw anybody get mixed up in other people’s business the way I do. And I’m a
man who doesn’t have a final answer about anything. Are you going to pound that meat or shall I
do it?”

She went back to work. “Do you think it’s funny to be so serious when I’m not even out of high
school?” she asked.
“I don’t see how it could be any other way,” said Lee. “Laughter comes later, like wisdom teeth,
and laughter at yourself comes last of all in a mad race with death, and sometimes it isn’t in time.”
Her tapping speeded up and its beat became erratic and nervous. Lee moved five dried lima beans
in pat-terns on the table—a line, an angle, a circle.
The beating stopped. “Is Mrs. Trask alive?”
Lee’s forefinger hung over a bean for a moment and then slowly fell and pushed it to make the O
into a Q. He knew she was looking at him. He could even see in his mind how her expression
would be one of panic at her question. His thought raced like a rat new caught in a wire trap. He
sighed and gave it up. He turned slowly and looked at her, and his picture had been accurate.
Lee said tonelessly, “We’ve talked a lot and I don’t remember that we have ever discussed me—
ever.” He smiled shyly. “Abra, let me tell you about myself. I’m a servant. I’m old. I’m Chinese.
These three you know. I’m tired and I’m cowardly.”
“You’re not—” she began.
“Be silent,” he said. “I am so cowardly. I will not put my finger in any human pie.”
“What do you mean?”
“Abra, is your father mad at anything except tur-nips?”
Her face went stubborn. “I asked you a question.”
“I did not hear a question,” he said softly and his voice became confident. “You did not ask a
question, Abra.”
“I guess you think I’m too young—” Abra began.
Lee broke in, “Once I worked for a woman of thirty-five who had successfully resisted
experience, learning, and beauty. If she had been six she would have been the despair of her
parents. And at thirty-five she was permitted to control money and the lives of people around her.
No, Abra, age has nothing to do with it. If I had anything at all to say—I would say it to you.”
The girl smiled at him. “I’m clever,” she said. “Shall I be clever?”
“God help me—no,” Lee protested.
“Then you don’t want me to try to figure it out?”
“I don’t care what you do as long as I don’t have anything to do with it. I guess no matter how
weak and negative a good man is, he has as many sins on him as he can bear. I have enough sins
to trouble me. Maybe they aren’t very fine sins compared to some, but, the way I feel, they’re all
I can take care of. Please forgive me.”
Abra reached across the table and touched the back of his hand with floury fingers. The yellow
skin on his hand was tight and glazed. He looked down at the white powdery smudges her fingers
left.
Abra said, “My father wanted a boy. I guess he hates turnips and girls. He tells everyone how he
gave me my crazy name. ‘And though I called another, Abra came.’ ”
Lee smiled at her. “You’re such a nice girl,” he said. “I’ll buy some turnips tomorrow if you’ll
come to din-ner.”

Abra asked softly, “Is she alive?”
“Yes,” said Lee.
The front door slammed, and Cal came into the kitchen. “Hello, Abra. Lee, is father home?”
“No, not yet. What are you grinning all over for?”
Cal handed him a check. “There. That’s for you.”
Lee looked at it. “I didn’t want interest,” he said.
“It’s better. I might want to borrow it back.”
“You won’t tell me where you got it?”
“No. Not yet. I’ve got a good idea—” His eyes flicked to Abra.
“I have to go home now,” she said.
Cal said, “She might as well be in on it. I decided to do it Thanksgiving, and Abra’ll probably be
around and Aron will be home.”
“Do what?” she asked.
“I’ve got a present for my father.”
“What is it?” Abra asked.
“I won’t tell. You’ll find out then.”
“Does Lee know?”
“Yes, but he won’t tell.”
“I don’t think I ever saw you so—gay,” Abra said. “I don’t think I ever saw you gay at all.” She
discovered in herself a warmth for him.
After Abra had gone Cal sat down. “I don’t know whether to give it to him before Thanksgiving
dinner or after,” he said.
“After,” said Lee. “Have you really got the money?”
“Fifteen thousand dollars.”
“Honestly?”
“You mean, did I steal it?”
“Yes.”
“Honestly,” said Cal. “Remember how we had champagne for Aron? We’ll get champagne. And
—well, we’ll maybe decorate the dining room. Maybe Abra’ll help.”
“Do you really think your father wants money?”
“Why wouldn’t he?”
“I hope you’re right,” said Lee. “How have you been doing in school?”
“Not very well. I’ll pick up after Thanksgiving,” said Cal.

2
After school the next day Abra hurried and caught up with Cal.
“Hello, Abra,” he said. “You make good fudge.”
“That last was dry. It should be creamy.”
“Lee is just crazy about you. What have you done to him?”
“I like Lee,” she said and then, “I want to ask you something, Cal.”

“Yes?”
“What’s the matter with Aron?”
“What do you mean?”
“He just seems to think only about himself.”
“I don’t think that’s very new. Have you had a fight with him?”
“No. When he had all that about going into the church and not getting married, I tried to fight
with him, but he wouldn’t.”
“Not get married to you? I can’t imagine that.”
“Cal, he writes me love letters now—only they aren’t to me.”
“Then who are they to?”
“It’s like they were to—himself.”
Cal said, “I know about the willow tree.”
She didn’t seem surprised. “Do you?” she asked.
“Are you mad at Aron?”
“No, not mad. I just can’t find him. I don’t know him.”
“Wait around,” said Cal. “Maybe he’s going through something.”
“I wonder if I’ll be all right. Do you think I could have been wrong all the time?”
“How do I know?”
“Cal,” she said, “is it true that you go out late at night and even go—to—bad houses?”
“Yes,” he said. “That’s true. Did Aron tell you?”
“No, not Aron. Well, why do you go there?”
He walked beside her and did not answer.
“Tell me,” she said.
“What’s it to you?”
“Is it because you’re bad?”
“What’s it sound like to you?”
“I’m not good either,” she said.
“You’re crazy,” said Cal. “Aron will knock that out of you.”
“Do you think he will?”
“Why, sure,” said Cal. “He’s got to.”

Chapter 45
1
Joe Valery got along by watching and listening and, as he said himself, not sticking his neck out.
He had built his hatreds little by little—beginning with a mother who neglected him, a father who
alternately whipped and slobbered over him. It had been easy to transfer his de-veloping hatred to
the teacher who disciplined him and the policeman who chased him and the priest who lec-tured
him. Even before the first magistrate looked down on him, Joe had developed a fine stable of
hates toward the whole world he knew.
Hate cannot live alone. It must have love as a trig-ger, a goad, or a stimulant. Joe early developed
a gentle protective love for Joe. He comforted and flattered and cherished Joe. He set up walls to
save Joe from a hostile world. And gradually Joe became proof against wrong. If Joe got into
trouble, it was because the world was in angry conspiracy against him. And if Joe at-tacked the
world, it was revenge and they damn well deserved it—the sons of bitches. Joe lavished every
care on his love, and he perfected a lonely set of rules which might have gone like this:
1. Don’t believe nobody. The bastards are after you.
2. Keep your mouth shut. Don’t stick your neck out.
3. Keep your ears open. When they make a slip, grab on to it and wait.
4. Everybody’s a son of a bitch and whatever you do they got it coming.
5. Go at everything roundabout.
6. Don’t never trust no dame about nothing.
7. Put your faith in dough. Everybody wants it. Everybody will sell out for it.
There were other rules, but they were refinements. His system worked, and since he knew no
other, Joe had no basis of comparison with other systems. He knew it was necessary to be smart
and he considered himself smart. If he pulled something off, that was smart; if he failed, that was
bad luck. Joe was not very successful but he got by and with a minimum of effort. Kate kept him
because she knew he would do anything in the world if he were paid to do it or was afraid not to
do it. She had no illusions about him. In her business Joes were necessary.
When he first got the job with Kate, Joe looked for the weaknesses on which he lived—vanity,
voluptuous-ness, anxiety or conscience, greed, hysteria. He knew they were there because she
was a woman. It was a matter of considerable shock to him to learn that, if they were there, he
couldn’t find them. This dame thought and acted like a man—only tougher, quicker, and more
clever. Joe made a few mistakes and Kate rubbed his nose in them. He developed an admiration
for her based on fear.
When he found that he couldn’t get away with some things, he began to believe he couldn’t get
away with anything. Kate made a slave of him just as he had always made slaves of women. She

fed him, clothed him, gave him orders, punished him.
Once Joe recognized her as more clever than himself, it was a short step to the belief that she was
more clever than anybody. He thought that she possessed the two great gifts: she was smart and
she got the breaks—and you couldn’t want no better than that. He was glad to do her hatchet work
—and afraid not to. Kate don’t make no mistakes, Joe said. And if you played along with her,
Kate took care of you. This went beyond thought and became a habit pattern. When he got Ethel
floated over the county line, it was all in the day’s work. It was Kate’s business and she was
smart.

2
Kate did not sleep well when the arthritic pains were bad. She could almost feel her joints thicken
and knot. Sometimes she tried to think of other things, even unpleasant ones, to drive the pain
and the distorted fingers from her mind. Sometimes she tried to remem-ber every detail in a room
she had not seen for a long time. Sometimes she looked at the ceiling and projected columns of
figures and added them. Sometimes she used memories. She built Mr. Edwards’ face and his
clothes and the word that was stamped on the metal clasp of his suspenders. She had never
noticed it, but she knew the word was “Excelsior.”
Often in the night she thought of Faye, remembered her eyes and hair and the tone of her voice
and how her hands fluttered and the little lump of flesh beside her left thumbnail, a scar from an
ancient cut. Kate went into her feeling about Faye. Did she hate or love her? Did she pity her?
Was she sorry she had killed her? Kate inched over her own thoughts like a measur-ing worm.
She found she had no feeling about Faye. She neither liked nor disliked her or her memory. There
had been a time during her dying when the noise and the smell of her had made anger rise in Kate
so that she considered killing her quickly to get it over.
Kate remembered how Faye had looked the last time she saw her, lying in her purple casket,
dressed in white, with the undertaker’s smile on her lips and enough powder and rouge to cover
her sallow skin.
A voice behind Kate had said, “She looks better than she has in years.” And another voice had
answered, “Maybe the same thing would do me some good,” and there was a double snicker. The
first voice would be Ethel, and the second Trixie. Kate remembered her own half-humorous
reaction. Why, she had thought, a dead whore looks like anybody else.
Yes, the first voice must have been Ethel. Ethel always got into the night thinking, and Ethel
always brought a shrinking fear with her, the stupid, clumsy, nosy bitch—the lousy old bag. And
it happened very often that Kate’s mind would tell her, “Now wait a moment. Why is she a lousy
old bag? Isn’t it because you made a mistake? Why did you float her? If you’d used your head
and kept her here—”
Kate wondered where Ethel was. How about one of those agencies to find Ethel—at least to find
where she went? Yes, and then Ethel would tell about that night and show the glass. Then there’d
be two noses sniffing instead of one. Yes, but what difference would that make? Every time Ethel
got a beer in her she would be telling somebody. Oh, sure, but they would think she was just a

buzzed old hustler. Now an agency man—no—no agencies.
Kate spent many hours with Ethel. Did the judge have any idea it was a frame—too simple? It
shouldn’t have been an even hundred dollars. That was obvious. And how about the sheriff? Joe
said they dropped her over the line into Santa Cruz County. What did Ethel tell the deputy who
drove her out? Ethel was a lazy old bat. Maybe she had stayed in Watsonville. There was Pajaro,
and that was a railroad section, and then the Pajaro River and the bridge into Watsonville. Lots of
section hands went back and forth, Mexicans, some Hindus. That puddlehead Ethel might have
thought she could turn enough tricks with the track workers. Wouldn’t it be funny if she had
never left Watsonville, thirty miles away? She could even slip in over the line and see her friends
if she wanted to. Maybe she came to Salinas sometimes. She might be in Salinas right now. The
cops weren’t likely to keep too much on the look for her. Maybe it would be a good idea to send
Joe over to Watsonville to see if Ethel was there. She might have gone on to Santa Cruz. Joe
could look there too. It wouldn’t take him long. Joe could find any hooker in any town in a few
hours. If he found her they could get her back somehow. Ethel was a fool. But maybe when he
found her it would be better if Kate went to her. Lock the door. Leave a “Do not disturb” sign.
She could get to Watsonville, do her business, and get back. No taxis. Take a bus. Nobody saw
anybody on the night buses. People sleeping with their shoes off and coats rolled up behind their
heads. Suddenly she knew she would be afraid to go to Watsonville. Well, she could make herself
go. It would stop all this won-dering. Strange she hadn’t thought of sending Joe be-fore. That was
perfect. Joe was good at some things, and the dumb bastard thought he was clever. That was the
kind easiest to handle. Ethel was stupid. That made her hard to handle.
As her hands and her mind grew more crooked, Kate began to rely more and more on Joe Valery
as her assistant in chief, as her go-between, and as her execu-tioner. She had a basic fear of the
girls in the house—not that they were more untrustworthy than Joe but that the hysteria which lay
very close to the surface might at any time crack through their caution and shatter their sense of
self-preservation and tear down not only themselves but their surroundings. Kate had always been
able to handle this ever-present danger, but now the slow-depositing calcium and the slow growth
of apprehension caused her to need help and to look for it from Joe. Men, she knew, had a little
stronger wall against self-destruction than the kind of women she knew.
She felt that she could trust Joe, because she had in her files a notation relating to one Joseph
Venuta who had walked away from a San Quentin road gang in the fourth year of a five-year
sentence for robbery. Kate had never mentioned this to Joe Valery , but she thought it might have
a soothing influence on him if he got out of hand.
Joe brought the breakfast tray every morning—green China tea and cream and toast. When he
had set it on her bedside table he made his report and got his orders for the day. He knew that she
was depending on him more and more. And Joe was very slowly and quietly exploring the
possibility of taking over entirely. If she got sick enough there might be a chance. But very
profoundly Joe was afraid of her.
“Morning,” he said.
“I’m not going to sit up for it, Joe. Just give me the tea. You’ll have to hold it.”

“Hands bad?”
“Yes. They get better after a flare up.”
“Looks like you had a bad night.”
“No,” said Kate. “I had a good night. I’ve got some new medicine.”
Joe held the cup to her lips, and she drank the tea in little sips, breathing in over it to cool it.
“That’s enough,” she said when the cup was only half empty. “How was the night?”
“I almost came to tell you last night,” said Joe. “Hick came in from King City. Just sold his crop.
Bought out the house. Dropped seven hundred not counting what he give the girls.”
“What was his name?”
“I don’t know. But I hope he comes in again.”
“You should get the name, Joe. I’ve told you that.”
“He was cagey.”
“All the more reason to get his name. Didn’t any of the girls frisk him?”
“I don’t know.”
“Well, find out.”
Joe sensed a mild geniality in her and it made him feel good. “I’ll find out,” he assured her. “I got
enough to go on.”
Her eyes went over him, testing and searching, and he knew something was coming. “You like it
here?” she asked softly.
“Sure. I got it good here.”
“You could have it better—or worse,” she said.
“I like it good here,’’ he said uneasily, and his mind cast about for a fault in himself. “I got it real
nice here.”
She moistened her lips with her arrow-shaped tongue. “You and I can work together,” she said.
“Any way you want it,” he said ingratiatingly, and a surge of pleasant expectation grew in him.
He waited patiently. She took a good long time to begin.
At last she said, “Joe, I don’t like to have anything stolen.”
“I didn’t take nothing.”
“I didn’t say you did.”
“Who?”
“I’ll get to it, Joe. Do you remember that old buz-zard we had to move?”
“You mean Ethel what’s-her-name?”
“Yes. That’s the one. She got away with something. I didn’t know it then.”
“What?”
A coldness crept into her voice. “Not your business, Joe. Listen to me! You’re a smart fellow.
Where would you go to look for her?”
Joe’s mind worked quickly, not with reason but with experience and instinct. “She was pretty
beat up. She wouldn’t go far. An old hustler don’t go far.”
“You’re smart. You think she might be in Watsonville?”
“There or maybe Santa Cruz. Anyways, I’ll give odds she ain’t farther away than San Jose.”

She caressed her fingers tenderly. “Would you like to make five hundred, Joe?”
“You want I should find her?”
“Yes. Just find her. When you do, don’t let her know. Just bring me the address. Got that? Just
tell me where she is.”
“Okay,” said Joe. “She must of rolled you good.”
“That’s not your business, Joe.”
“Yes, ma’am,” he said. “You want I should start right off?”
“Yes. Make it quick, Joe.”
“Might be a little tough,” he said. “It’s been a long time.”
“That’s up to you.”
“I’ll go to Watsonville this afternoon.”
“That’s good, Joe.”
She was thoughtful. He knew she was not finished and that she was wondering whether she
should go on. She decided.
“Joe, did—did she do anything—well, peculiar—that day in court?”
“Hell, no. Said she was framed like they always do.”
And then something came back to him that he hadn’t noticed at the time. Out of his memory
Ethel’s voice came, saying, “Judge, I got to see you alone. I got to tell you something.” He tried
to bury his memory deep so that his face would not speak.
Kate said, “Well, what was it?”
He had been too late. His mind leaped for safety. “There’s something,” he said to gain time. “I’m
trying to think.”
“Well, think!” Her voice was edged and anxious.
“Well—” He had it. “Well, I heard her tell the cops—let’s see—she said why couldn’t they let
her go south. She said she had relatives in San Luis Obispo.”
Kate leaned quickly toward him. “Yes?”
“And the cops said it was too damn far.”
“You’re smart, Joe. Where will you go first?”
“Watsonville,” he said. “I got a friend in San Luis. He’ll look around for me. I’ll give him a ring.”
“Joe,” she said sharply. “I want this quiet.”
“For five hundred you’ll get it quiet and quick,” said Joe. He felt fine even though her eyes were
suited and inspective again. Her next words jarred his stomach loose from his backbone.
“Joe, not to change the subject—does the name Venuta mean anything to you?”
He tried to answer before his throat tightened. “Not a thing,” he said.
“Come back as soon as you can,” Kate said. “Tell Helen to come in. She’ll take over for you.”

Joe packed his suitcase, went to the depot, and bought a ticket for Watsonville. At Castroville, the
first station north, he got off and waited four hours for the Del Monte express from San Francisco
to Monterey, which is at the end of a spur line. In Monterey he climbed the stairs of the Central

Hotel, registered as John Vicker. He went downstairs and ate a steak at Pop Ernst’s, bought a
bottle of whisky, and retired to his room.
He took off his shoes and his coat and vest, removed his collar and tie, and lay down on the bed.
The whisky and a glass were on the table beside the brass bed. The overhead light shining in his
face didn’t bother him. He didn’t notice it. Methodically he primed his brain with half a tumbler
of whisky and then he crossed his hands behind his head and crossed his ankles and he brought
out thoughts and impressions and perceptions and in-stincts and began matching them.
It had been a good job and he had thought he had her fooled. Well, he’d underrated her. But how
in hell had she got onto it he was wanted? He thought he might go to Reno or maybe to Seattle.
Seaport towns—always good. And then—now wait a minute. Think about it.
Ethel didn’t steal nothing. She had something. Kate was scared of Ethel. Five hundred was a lot
of dough to dig out a beat-up whore. What Ethel wanted to tell the judge was, number one, true;
and, number two, Kate was scared of it. Might be able to use that. Hell!—not with her holding
that jailbreak over him. Joe wasn’t going to serve out the limit with penalties.
But no harm in thinking about it. Suppose he was to gamble four years against—well, let’s say
ten grand. Was that a bad bet? No need to decide. She knew it before and didn’t turn him in.
Suppose she thought he was a good dog.
Maybe Ethel might be a hole-card.
Now—wait—just think about it. Maybe it was the breaks. Maybe he ought to draw his hand and
see. But she was so goddam smart. Joe wondered if he could play against her. But how, if he just
played along?
Joe sat up and filled his glass full. He turned off his light and raised his shade. And as he drank
his whisky he watched a skinny little woman in a bathrobe wash-ing her stockings in a basin in a
room on the other side of the air shaft. And the whisky muttered in his ears.
It might be the breaks. God knows, Joe had waited long enough. God knows, he hated the bitch
with her sharp little teeth. No need to decide right now.
He raised his window quietly and threw the writing pen from the table against the window across
the air shaft. He enjoyed the scene of fear and apprehension before the skinny dame yanked her
shade down.
With the third glass of whisky the pint was empty. Joe felt a wish to go out in the street and look
the town over. But then his discipline took over. He had made a rule, and kept to it, never to leave
his room when he was drinking. That way a man never got in trouble. Trouble meant cops, and
cops meant a check-up, and that would surely mean a trip across the bay to San Quentin and no
road gang for good behavior this time. He put the street out of his mind.
Joe had another pleasure he saved for times when he was alone, and he was not aware it was a
pleasure. He indulged it now. He lay on the brass bed and went back in time over his sullen and
miserable childhood and his fretful and vicious growing up. No luck—he never got the breaks.
The big shots got the breaks. A few snatch jobs he got away with, but the tray of pocketknives?
Cops came right in his house and got him. Then he was on the books and they never let him
alone. Guy in Daly City couldn’t shag a crate of strawberries off a truck without they’d pick up

Joe. In school he didn’t have no luck neither. Teachers against him, principal against him. Guy
couldn’t take that crap. Had to get out.
Out of his memory of bad luck a warm sadness grew, and he pushed it with more memories until
the tears came to his eyes and his lips quivered with pity for the lonely lost boy he had been. And
here he was now—look at him—a rap against him, working in a whorehouse when other men had
homes and cars. They were safe and happy and at night their blinds were pulled down against
Joe. He wept quietly until he fell asleep.
Joe got up at ten in the morning and ate a monster breakfast at Pop Ernst’s. In the early afternoon
he took a bus to Watsonville and played three games of snooker with a friend who came to meet
him in answer to a phone call. Joe won the last game and racked his cue. He handed his friend
two ten-dollar bills.
“Hell,” said his friend, “I don’t want your money.”
“Take it,” said Joe.
“It ain’t like I give you anything.”
“You give me plenty. You say she ain’t here and you’re the baby that would know.”
“Can’t tell me what you want her for?”
“Wilson, I tol’ you right first an’ I tell you now, I don’t know. I’m jus’ doing a job of work.”
“Well, that’s all I can do. Seems like there was this convention—what was it?—dentists, or
maybe Owls. I don’t know whether she said she was going or I just figured it myself. I got it
stuck in my mind. Give Santa Cruz a whirl. Know anybody?”
“I got a few acquaintances,” said Joe.
“Look up H. V. Mahler, Hal Mahler. He runs Hal’s poolroom. Got a game in back.”
“Thanks,” said Joe.
“No—look, Joe. I don’t want your money.”
“It ain’t my money—buy a cigar,” said Joe.
The bus dropped him two doors from Hal’s place. It was suppertime but the stud game was still
going. It was an hour before Hal got up to go to the can and Joe could follow and make a
connection. Hal peered at Joe with large pale eyes made huge by thick glasses. He buttoned his
fly slowly and adjusted his black alpaca sleeve guards and squared his green eyeshade. “Stick
around till the game breaks,” he said. “Care to sit in?”
“How many playing for you, Hal?”
“Only one.”
“I’ll play for you.”
“Five bucks an hour,” said Hal.
“An’ ten per cent if I win?”
“Well, okay. Sandy-haired fella Williams is the house.”
At one o’clock in the morning Hal and Joe went to Barlow’s Grill. “Two rib steaks and french
fries. You want soup?” Hal asked Joe.
“No. And no french fries. They bind me up.”
“Me too,” said Hal. “But I eat them just the same. I don’t get enough exercise.”

Hal was a silent man until he was eating. He rarely spoke unless his mouth was full. “What’s
your pitch?” he asked around steak.
“Just a job. I make a hundred bucks and you get twenty-five—okay?”
“Got to have like proof—like papers?”
“No. Be good but I’ll get by without them.”
“Well, she come in and wants me to steer for her. She wasn’t no good. I didn’t take twenty a
week off her. I probably wouldn’t of knew what become of her only Bill Primus seen her in my
place and when they found her he come in an’ ast me about her. Nice fella, Bill. We got a nice
force here.”
Ethel was not a bad woman—lazy, sloppy, but good-hearted. She wanted dignity and importance.
She was just not very bright and not very pretty and, because of these two lacks, not very lucky. It
would have bothered Ethel if she had known that when they pulled her out of the sand where
waves had left her half buried, her skirts were pulled around her ass. She would have liked more
dignity.
Hal said, “We got some crazy bohunk bastards in the sardine fleet. Get loaded with ink an’ they
go nuts. Way I figure, one of them sardine crews took her out an’ then jus’ pushed her overboard.
I don’t see how else she’d get in the water.”
“Maybe she jumped off the pier?”
“Her?” said Hal through potatoes. “Hell, no! She was too blamed lazy to kill herself. You want to
check?”
“If you say it’s her, it’s her,” said Joe, and he pushed a twenty and a five across the table.
Hal rolled the bills like a cigarette and put them in his vest pocket. He cut out the triangle of meat
from the rib steak and put it in his mouth. “It was her,” he said. “Want a piece of pie?”
Joe meant to sleep until noon but he awakened at seven and lay in bed for quite a long time. He
planned not to get back to Salinas until after midnight. He needed more time to think.
When he got up he looked in the mirror and inspect-ed the expression he planned to wear. He
wanted to look disappointed but not too disappointed. Kate was so goddam clever. Let her lead.
Just follow suit. She was about as wide open as a fist. Joe had to admit that he was scared to
death of her.
His caution said to him, “Just go in and tell her and get your five hundred.”
And he answered his caution savagely, “Breaks. How many breaks did I ever get? Part of the
breaks is knowing a break when you get it. Do I want to be a lousy pimp all my life? Just play it
close. Let her do the talking. No harm in that. I can always tell her later like I just found out if it
don’t go good.”
“She could have you in a cell block in six hours flat.”
“Not if I play ’em close. What I got to lose? What breaks did I ever get?”

Kate was feeling better. The new medicine seemed to be doing her some good. The pain in her
hands was abated, and it seemed to her that her fingers were straighter, the knuckles not so

swollen. She had had a good night’s sleep, the first in a long time, and she felt good, even a little
excited. She planned to have a boiled egg for breakfast. She got up and put on a dressing gown
and brought a hand mirror back to the bed. Lying high against the pillows, she studied her face.
The rest had done wonders. Pain makes you set your jaw, and your eyes grow falsely bright with
anxiety, and the muscles over the temples and along the cheeks, even the weak muscles near to
the nose, stand out a little, and that is the look of sickness and of resistance to suffering.
The difference in her rested face was amazing. She looked ten years younger. She opened her lips
and looked at her teeth. Time to go for a cleaning. She took care of her teeth. The gold bridge
where the molars were gone was the only repair in her mouth. It was remark-able how young she
looked, Kate thought. Just one night’s sleep and she snapped back. That was another thing that
fooled them. They thought she would be weak and delicate. She smiled to herself—delicate like a
steel trap. But then she always took care of herself—no liquor, no drugs, and recently she had
stopped drinking coffee. And it paid off. She had an angelic face. She put the mirror a little
higher so that the crepe at her throat did not reflect.
Her thought jumped to that other angelic face so like hers—what was his name?—what the hell
was his name—Alec? She could see him, moving slowly past, his white surplice edged with lace,
his sweet chin down and his hair glowing under the candlelight. He held the oaken staff and its
brass cross angled ahead of him. There was something frigidly beautiful about him, something
untouched and untouchable. Well, had any-thing or anybody ever really touched Kate—really got
through and soiled her? Certainly not. Only the hard outside had been brushed by contacts. Inside
she was intact—as clean and bright as this boy Alec—was that his name?
She chuckled—mother of two sons—and she looked like a child. And if anyone had seen her
with the blond one—could they have any doubt? She thought how it would be to stand beside
him in a crowd and let people find out for themselves. What would—Aron, that was the name—
what would he do if he knew? His brother knew. That smart little son of a bitch—wrong word—
must not call him that. Might be too true. Some people believed it. And not smart bastard either—
born in holy wedlock. Kate laughed aloud. She felt good. She was having a good time.
The smart one—the dark one—bothered her. He was like Charles. She had respected Charles—
and Charles would probably have killed her if he could.
Wonderful medicine—it not only stopped the arthrit-ic pain, it gave her back her courage. Pretty
soon she could sell out and go to New York as she had always planned. Kate thought of her fear
of Ethel. How sick she must- have been—the poor dumb old bag! How would it be to murder her
with kindness? When Joe found her, how about—well, how about taking her on to New York?
Keep her close.
A funny notion came to Kate. That would be a comical murder, and a murder no one under any
cir-cumstances could solve or even suspect. Chocolates—boxes of chocolates, bowls of fondant,
bacon, crisp bacon—fat, port wine, and then butter, everything soaked in butter and whipped
cream; no vegetables, no fruit—and no amusement either. Stay in the house, dear. I trust you.
Look after things. You’re tired. Go to bed. Let me fill your glass. I got these new sweets for you.
Would you like to take the box to bed? Well, if you don’t feel good why don’t you take a physic?

These cashews are nice, don’t you think? The old bitch would blow up and burst in six months.
Or how about a tapeworm? Did anyone ever use tapeworms? Who was the man who couldn’t get
water to his mouth in a sieve—Tantalus?
Kate’s lips were smiling sweetly and a gaiety was coming over her. Before she went it might be
good to give a party for her sons. Just a simple little party with a circus afterward for her darlings
—her jewels. And then she thought of Aron’s beautiful face so like her own and a strange pain—
a little collapsing pain—arose in her chest. He wasn’t smart. He couldn’t protect himself. The
dark brother might be dangerous. She had felt his quality. Cal had beaten her. Before she went
away she would teach him a lesson. Maybe—why, sure—maybe a dose of the clap might set that
young man back on his heels.
Suddenly she knew that she did not want Aron to know about her. Maybe he could come to her in
New York. He would think she had always lived in an elegant little house on the East Side. She
would take him to the theater, to the opera, and people would see them together and wonder at
their loveliness, and rec-ognize that they were either brother and sister or moth-er and son. No
one could fail to know. They could go together to Ethel’s funeral. She would need an oversized
coffin and six wrestlers to carry it. Kate was so filled with amusement at her thoughts that she did
not hear Joe’s knocking on the door. He opened it a crack and looked in and saw her gay and
smiling face.
“Breakfast,” he said and nudged the door open with the edge of the linen-covered tray. He pushed
the door closed with his knee. “Want it there?” he asked and gestured toward the gray room with
his chin.
“No. I’ll have it right here. And I want a boiled egg and a piece of cinnamon toast. Four and a
half minutes on the egg. Make sure. I don’t want it gooey.”
“You must feel better, ma’am.”
“I do,” she said. “That new medicine is wonderful. You look dragged by dogs, Joe. Don’t you
feel well?”
“I’m all right,” he said and set the tray on the table in front of the big deep chair. “Four and a half
min-utes?”
“That’s right. And if there’s a good apple—a crisp apple—bring that too.”
“You ain’t et like this since I knew you,” he said.
In the kitchen, waiting for the cook to boil the egg, he was apprehensive. Maybe she knew. He’d
have to be careful. But hell! she couldn’t hate him for something he didn’t know. No crime in
that.
Back in her room he said, “Didn’t have no apples. He said this was a good pear.”
“I’d like that even better,” said Kate.
He watched her chip off the egg and dip a spoon into the shell. “How is it?”
“Perfect!” said Kate. “Just perfect.”
“You look good,” he said.
“I feel good. You look like hell. What’s the matter?”
Joe went into it warily. “Ma’am, there ain’t nobody needs five hundred like I do.”

She said playfully, “There isn’t anyone who needs—”
“What?”
“Forget it. What are you trying to say? You couldn’t find her—is that it? Well, if you did a good
job look-ing, you’ll get your five hundred. Tell me about it.” She picked up the salt shaker and
scattered a few grains into the open eggshell.
Joe put an artificial joy on his face. “Thanks,” he said. “I’m in a spot. I need it. Well, I looked in
Pajaro and Watsonville. Got a line on her in Watsonville but she’d went to Santa” Cruz. Got a
smell of her there but she was gone.”
Kate tasted the egg and added more salt. “That all?”
“No,” said Joe. “I went it blind there. Dropped down to San Luis an’ she had been there too but
gone.”
“No trace? No idea where she went?”
Joe fiddled with his fingers. His whole pitch, maybe his whole life, depended on his next words,
and he was reluctant to say them.
“Come on,” she said at last. “You got something—what is it?”
“Well, it ain’t much. I don’t know what to think of it.”
“Don’t think. Just tell. I’ll think,” she said sharply.
“Might not even be true.”
“For Christ’s sake!” she said angrily.
“Well, I talked to the last guy that seen her. Guy named Joe, like me—”
“Did you get his grandmother’s name?” she asked sarcastically.
“This guy Joe says she loaded up on beer one night an’ she said how she’s going to come back to
Salinas an’ lay low. Then she dropped out of sight. This guy Joe didn’t know nothing more.”
Kate was startled out of control. Joe read her quick start, the apprehension, and then the almost
hopeless fear and weariness. Whatever it was, Joe had some-thing. He had got the breaks at last.
She looked up from her lap and her twisted fingers. “We’ll forget the old fart,” she said. “You’ll
get your five hundred, Joe.”
Joe breathed shallowly, afraid that any sound might drag her out of her self-absorption. She had
believed him. More than that, she was believing things he had not told her. He wanted to get out
of the room as quickly as possible. He said, “Thank you, ma’am,” but very softly, and he moved
silently toward the door.
His hand was on the knob when she spoke with elaborate casualness. “Joe, by the way—”
“Ma’am?”
“If you should hear anything about—her, let me know, will you?”
“I sure will. Want me to dig into it?”
“No. Don’t bother. It isn’t that important.”
In his room, with the door latched, Joe sat down and folded his arms. He smiled to himself. And
instantly he began to work out the future course. He decided to let her brood on it till, say, next
week. Let her relax, and then bring up Ethel again. He did not know what his weapon was or how
he was going to use it. But he did know that it was very sharp and he itched to use it. He would

have laughed out loud if he had known that Kate had gone to the gray room and locked its door,
and that she sat still in the big chair and her eyes were closed.

PART FIVE

Chapter 46
Sometimes, but not often, a rain comes to the Salinas Valley in November. It is so rare that the
Journal or the Index or both carry editorials about it. The hills turn to a soft green overnight and
the air smells good. Rain at this time is not particularly good in an agricul-tural sense unless it is
going to continue, and this is extremely unusual. More commonly, the dryness comes back and
the fuzz of grass withers or a little frost curls it and there’s that amount of seed wasted.
The war years were wet years, and there were many people who blamed the strange intransigent
weather on the firing of the great guns in France. This was serious-ly considered in articles and in
arguments.
We didn’t have many troops in France that first winter, but we had millions in training, getting
ready to go—painful as the war was, it was exciting too. The Germans were not stopped. In fact,
they had taken the initiative again, driving methodically toward Paris, and God knew when they
could be stopped—if they could be stopped at all. General Pershing would save us if we could be
saved. His trim, beautifully uniformed soldier-ly figure made its appearance in every paper every
day. His chin was granite and there was no wrinkle on his tunic. He was the epitome of a perfect
soldier. No one knew what he really thought.
We knew we couldn’t lose and yet we seemed to be going about losing. You couldn’t buy flour,
white flour, any more without taking four times the quantity of brown flour. Those who could
afford it ate bread and biscuits made with white flour and made mash for the chickens with the
brown.
In the old Troop C armory the Home Guard drilled, men over fifty and not the best soldier
material, but they took setting-up exercises twice a week, wore Home Guard buttons and overseas
caps, snapped orders at one another, and wrangled eternally about who should be officers.
William C. Burt died right on the armory floor in the middle of a push-up. His heart couldn’t take
it.
There were Minute Men too, so called because they made one-minute speeches in favor of
America in mov-ing-picture theaters and in churches. They had buttons too.
The women rolled bandages and wore Red Cross uniforms and thought of themselves as Angels
of Mer-cy. And everybody knitted something for someone. There were wristlets, short tubes of
wool to keep the wind from whistling up soldiers’ sleeves, and there were knitted helmets with
only a hole in front to look out of. These were designed to keep the new tin helmets from freezing
to the head.
Every bit of really first-grade leather was taken for officers’ boots and for Sam Browne belts.
These belts were handsome and only officers could wear them. They consisted of a wide belt and
a strip that crossed the chest and passed under the left epaulet. We copied them from the British,
and even the British had forgot-ten their original purpose, which was possibly to sup-port a heavy

sword. Swords were not carried except on parade, but an officer would not be caught dead without a Sam Browne belt. A good one cost as much as twenty-five dollars.
We learned a lot from the British—and if they had not been good fighting men we wouldn’t have
taken it. Men began to wear their handkerchiefs in their sleeves and some foppish lieutenants
carried swagger sticks. One thing we resisted for a long time, though. Wrist-watches were just too
silly. It didn’t seem likely that we would ever copy the Limeys in that.
We had our internal enemies too, and we exercised vigilance. San Jose had a spy scare, and
Salinas was not likely to be left behind—not the way Salinas was growing.
For about twenty years Mr. Fenchel had done hand tailoring in Salinas. He was short and round
and he had an accent that made you laugh. All day he sat cross-legged on his table in the little
shop on Alisal Street, and in the evening he walked home to his small white house far out on
Central Avenue. He was forever painting his house and the white picket fence in front of it.
Nobody had given his accent a thought until the war came along, but suddenly we knew. It was
Ger-man. We had our own personal German. It didn’t do him any good to bankrupt himself
buying war bonds. That was too easy a way to cover up.
The Home Guard wouldn’t take him in. They didn’t want a spy knowing their secret plans for
defending Salinas. And who wanted to wear a suit made by an enemy? Mr. Fenchel sat all day on
his table and he didn’t have anything to do, so he basted and ripped and sewed and ripped on the
same piece of cloth over and over.
We used every cruelty we could think of on Mr. Fenchel. He was our German. He passed our
house every day, and there had been a time when he spoke to every man and woman and child
and dog, and every-one had answered. Now no one spoke to him, and I can see now in my mind
his tubby loneliness and his face full of hurt pride.
My little sister and I did our part with Mr. Fenchel, and it is one of those memories of shame that
still makes me break into a sweat and tighten up around the throat. We were standing in our front
yard on the lawn one evening and we saw him coming with little fat steps. His black homburg
was brushed and squarely set on his head. I don’t remember that we discussed our plan but we
must have, to have carried it out so well.
As he came near, my sister and I moved slowly across the street side by side. Mr. Fenchel looked
up and saw us moving toward him. We stopped in the gutter as he came by.
He broke into a smile and said, “Gut efning, Chon. Gut efning, Mary.”
We stood stiffly side by side and we said in unison, “Hoch der Kaiser!”
I can see his face now, his startled innocent blue eyes. He tried to say something and then he
began to cry. Didn’t even try to pretend he wasn’t. He just stood there sobbing. And do you
know?—Mary and I turned around and walked stiffly across the street and into our front yard.
We felt horrible. I still do when I think of it.
We were too young to do a good job on Mr. Fen-chel. That took strong men—about thirty of
them. One Saturday night they collected in a bar and marched in a column of fours out Central
Avenue, saying, “Hup! Hup!” in unison. They tore down Mr. Fenchel’s white picket fence and
burned the front out of his house. No Kaiser-loving son of a bitch was going to get away with it

with us. And then Salinas could hold up its head with San Jose.
Of course that made Watsonville get busy. They tarred and feathered a Pole they thought was a
Ger-man. He had an accent.
We of Salinas did all of the things that are inevitably done in a war, and we thought the inevitable
thoughts. We screamed over good rumors and died of panic at bad news. Everybody had a secret
that he had to spread obliquely to keep its identity as a secret. Our pattern of life changed in the
usual manner. Wages and prices went up. A whisper of shortage caused us to buy and store food.
Nice quiet ladies clawed one another over a can of tomatoes.
It wasn’t all bad or cheap or hysterical. There was heroism too. Some men who could have
avoided the army enlisted, and others objected to the war on moral or religious grounds and took
the walk up Golgotha which normally comes with that. There were people who gave everything
they had to the war because it was the last war and by winning it we would remove war like a
thorn from the flesh of the world and there wouldn’t be any more such horrible nonsense.
There is no dignity in death in battle. Mostly that is a splashing about of human meat and fluid,
and the result is filthy, but there is a great and almost sweet dignity in the sorrow, the helpless,
the hopeless sorrow, that comes down over a family with the telegram. Nothing to say, nothing to
do, and only one hope—I hope he didn’t suffer—and what a forlorn and last-choice hope that is.
And it is true that there were some people who, when their sorrow was beginning to lose its
savor, gently edged it toward pride and felt increasingly important because of their loss. Some of
these even made a good thing of it after the war was over. That is only natural, just as it is natural
for a man whose life function is the making of money to make money out of a war. No one
blamed a man for that, but it was expected that he should invest a part of his loot in war bonds.
We thought we invented all of it in Salinas, even the sorrow.

Chapter 47
1
In the Trask house next to Reynaud’s Bakery, Lee and Adam put up a map of the western front
with lines of colored pins snaking down, and this gave them a feeling of participation. Then Mr.
Kelly died and Adam Trask was appointed to take his place on the draft board. He was the logical
man for the job. The ice plant did not take up much of his time, and he had a clear service record
and an honorable discharge himself.
Adam Trask had seen a war—a little war of maneu-ver and butchery, but at least he had
experienced the reversal of the rules where a man is permitted to kill all the humans he can.
Adam didn’t remember his war very well. Certain sharp pictures stood out in his memo-ry, a
man’s face, the piled and burning bodies, the clang of saber scabbards at fast trot, the uneven,
tearing sound of firing carbines, the thin cold voice of a bugle in the night. But Adam’s pictures
were frozen. There was no motion or emotion in them—illustrations in the pages of a book, and
not very well drawn.
Adam worked hard and honestly and sadly. He could not get over the feeling that the young men
he passed to the army were under sentence of death. And because he knew he was weak, he grew
more and more stern and painstaking and much less likely to accept an excuse or a borderline
disability. He took the lists home with him, called on parents, in fact, did much more work than
was expected of him. He felt like a hanging judge who hates the gallows.
Henry Stanton watched Adam grow more gaunt and more silent, and Henry was a man who liked
fun—needed it. A sour-pussed associate could make him sick.
“Relax,” he told Adam. “You’re trying to carry the weight of the war. Now, look—it’s not your
responsi-bility. You got put in here with a set of rules. Just fol-low the rules and relax. You aren’t
running the war.”
Adam moved the slats of the blind so that the late afternoon sun would not shine in his eyes, and
he gazed down at the harsh parallel lines the sun threw on his desk. “I know,” he said wearily.
“Oh, I know that! But, Henry, it’s when there’s a choice, and it’s my own judg-ment of the
merits, that’s when it gets me. I passed Judge Kendal’s boy and he was killed in training.”
“It’s not your business, Adam. Why don’t you take a few drinks at night? Go to a movie—sleep
on it.” Henry put his thumbs in the armholes of his vest and leaned back in his chair. “While
we’re talking about it, Adam, it seems to me it don’t do a candidate a damn bit of good for you to
worry. You pass boys I could be talked into letting off.”
“I know,” said Adam. “I wonder how long it will last?”
Henry inspected him shrewdly and took a pencil from his stuffed vest pocket and rubbed the
eraser against his big white front teeth. “I see what you mean,” he said softly.

Adam looked at him, startled. “What do I mean?” he demanded.
“Now don’t get huffy. I never thought I was lucky before, just having girls.”
Adam traced one of the slat shadows on his desk with his forefinger. “Yes,” he said in a voice as
soft as a sigh.
“It’s a long time before your boys will be called up.”
“Yes.” Adam’s finger entered a line of light and slid slowly back.
Henry said, “I’d hate to—”
“Hate to what?”
“I was just wondering how I’d feel if I had to pass on my own sons.”
“I’d resign,” said Adam.
“Yes. I can see that. A man would be tempted to reject them—I mean, his own.”
“No,” said Adam. “I’d resign because I couldn’t reject them. A man couldn’t let his own go free.”
Henry laced his fingers and made one big fist of his two hands and laid the fist on the desk in
front of him. His face was querulous. “No,” he said, “you’re right. A man couldn’t.” Henry liked
fun and avoided when he could any solemn or serious matter, for he confused these with sorrow.
“How’s Aron doing at Stanford?”
“Fine. He writes that it’s hard but he thinks he’ll make out all right. He’ll be home for
Thanksgiving.”
“I’d like to see him. I saw Cal on the street last night. There’s a smart boy.”
“Cal didn’t take college tests a year ahead,” said Adam.
“Well, maybe that’s not what he’s cut out for. I didn’t go to college. Did you?”
“No,” said Adam. “I went into the army.”
“Well, it’s a good experience. I’ll bet you wouldn’t take a good bit for the experience.”
Adam stood up slowly and picked his hat from the deer horns on the wall. “Good night, Henry,”
he said.

Walking home, Adam pondered his responsibility. As he passed Reynaud’s Bakery Lee came out,
carrying a golden loaf of French bread.
“I have a hunger for some garlic bread,” Lee said.
“I like it with steak,” said Adam.
“We’re having steak. Was there any mail?”
“I forgot to look in the box.”
They entered the house and Lee went to the kitchen. In a moment Adam followed him and sat at
the kitchen table. “Lee,” he said, “suppose we send a boy to the army and he is killed, are we
responsible?”
“Go on,” said Lee. “I would rather have the whole thing at once.”
“Well, suppose there’s a slight doubt that the boy should be in the army and we send him and he
gets killed.”
“I see. Is it responsibility or blame that bothers you?”

“I don’t want blame.”
“Sometimes responsibility is worse. It doesn’t carry any pleasant egotism.”
“I was thinking about that time when Sam Hamilton and you and I had a long discussion about a
word,” said Adam. “What was that word?”
“Now I see. The word was timshel.”
“Timshel—and you said—”
“I said that word carried a man’s greatness if he wanted to take advantage of it.”
“I remember Sam Hamilton felt good about it.”
“It set him free,” said Lee. “It gave him the right to be a man, separate from every other man.”
“That’s lonely.”
“All great and precious things are lonely.”
“What is the word again?”
“Timshel—thou mayest.”

Adam looked forward to Thanksgiving when Aron would come home from college. Even though
Aron had been away such a short time Adam had forgotten him and changed him the way any
man changes someone he loves. With Aron gone, the silences were the result of his going, and
every little painful event was somehow tied to his absence. Adam found himself talking and
boasting about his son, telling people who weren’t very interested how smart Aron was and how
he had jumped a year in school. He thought it would be a good thing to have a real celebration at
Thanksgiving to let the boy know his effort was appreciated.
Aron lived in a furnished room in Palo Alto, and he walked the mile to and from the campus
every day. He was miserable. What he had expected to find at the university had been vague and
beautiful. His picture—never really inspected—had been of clean-eyed young men and
immaculate girls, all in academic robes and converging on a white temple on the crown of a
wooded hill in the evening. Their faces were shining and dedi-cated and their voices rose in
chorus and it was never any time but evening. He had no idea where he had got his picture of
academic life—perhaps from the Doré illustrations of Dante’s Inferno with its massed and radiant
angels. Leland Stanford University was not like that. A formal square of brown sandstone blocks
set down in a hayfield; a church with an Italian mosaic front; classrooms of varnished pine; and
the great world of struggle and anger re-enacted in the rise and fall of fraternities. And those
bright angels were youths in dirty corduroy trousers, some study-raddled and some learning the
small vices of their fathers.
Aron, who had not known he had a home, was nauseatingly homesick. He did not try to learn the
life around him or to enter it. He found the natural noise and fuss and horseplay of
undergraduates horrifying, after his dream. He left the college dormitory for a dreary furnished
room where he could decorate another dream which had only now come into being. In the new
and neutral hiding place he cut the university out, went to his classes and left as soon as he could,
to live in his new-found memories. The house next to Reynaud’s Bakery became warm and dear,

Lee the epitome of friend and counselor, his father the cool, dependable figure of godhead, his
brother clever and delightful, and Abra—well, of Abra he made his immaculate dream and,
having created her, fell in love with her. At night when his studying was over he went to his
nightly letter to her as one goes to a scented bath. And as Abra became more radiant, more pure
and beautiful, Aron took an increasing joy in a concept of his own wicked-ness. In a frenzy he
poured joyous abjectness on paper to send to her, and he went to bed purified, as a man is after
sexual love. He set down every evil thought he had and renounced it. The results were love letters
that dripped with longing and by their high tone made Abra very uneasy. She could not know that
Aron’s sexuali-ty had taken a not unusual channel.
He had made a mistake. He could admit the mistake but as yet he could not reverse himself. He
made a compact with himself. At Thanksgiving he would go home, and then he would be sure.
He might never come back. He remembered that Abra had once sug-gested that they go to live on
the ranch, and that became his dream. He remembered the great oaks and the clear living air, the
clean sage-laced wind from the hills and the brown oak leaves scudding. He could see Abra there,
standing under a tree, waiting for him to come in from his work. And it was evening. There, after
work of course, he could live in purity and peace with the world, cut off by the little draw. He
could hide from ugliness—in the evening.

Chapter 48

Late in November the Nigger died and was buried in black austerity, as her will demanded. She
lay for a day in Muller’s Funeral Chapel in an ebony and silver casket, her lean and severe profile
made even more ascetic by the four large candles set at the four corners of the casket.
Her little black husband crouched like a cat by her right shoulder, and for many hours he seemed
as still as she. There were no flowers, as ordered, no ceremony, no sermon, and no grief. But a
strange and catholic selection of citizens tiptoed to the chapel door and peered in and went away
—lawyers and laborers and clerks and bank tellers, most of them past middle age. Her girls came
in one at a time and looked at her for decency and for luck and went away.
An institution was gone from Salinas, dark and fatal sex, as hopeless and deeply hurtful as human
sacrifice. Jenny’s place would still jangle with honky-tonk and rock with belching laughter.
Kate’s would rip the nerves to a sinful ecstasy and leave a man shaken and weak and frightened
at himself. But the somber mystery of connection that was like a voodoo offering was gone
forever.
The funeral was also by order of the will, the hearse and one automobile with the small black
man crouched back in a corner. It was a gray day, and when Muller’s service had lowered the
casket with oiled and silent winches the hearse drove away and the husband filled the grave
himself with a new shovel. The caretaker, cutting dry weeds a hundred yards away, heard a whining carried on the wind.
Joe Valery had been drinking a beer with Butch Bea-vers at the Owl, and he went with Butch to
have a look at the Nigger. Butch was in a hurry because he had to go out to Natividad to auction a
small herd of white-face Herefords for the Tavernettis.
Coming out of the mortuary, Joe found himself in step with Alf Nichelson—crazy Alf Nichelson,
who was a survival from an era that was past. Alf was a jack-of-all-trades, carpenter, tinsmith,
blacksmith, electrician, plasterer, scissors grinder, and cobbler. Alf could do anything, and as a
result he was a financial failure although he worked all the time. He knew everything about
everybody back to the beginning of time.
In the past, in the period of his success, two kinds of people had access to all homes and all gossip
—the seamstress and the handy man. Alf could tell you about everybody on both sides of Main
Street. He was a vicious male gossip, insatiably curious and vindictive without malice.
He looked at Joe and tried to place him. “I know you,” he said. “Don’t tell me.”
Joe edged away. He was wary of people who knew him.
“Wait a minute. I got it. Kate’s. You work at Kate’s.”
Joe sighed with relief. He had thought Alf might have known him earlier. “That’s right,” he said

shortly.
“Never forget a face,” said Alf. “Seen you when I built that crazy lean-to for Kate. Now why in
hell did she want that for? No window.”
“Wanted it dark,” said Joe, “Eyes bother her.”
Alf sniffed. He hardly ever believed anything simple or good about anybody. You could say good
morning to Alf and he’d work it around to a password. He was convinced that everyone lived
secretly and that only he could see through them.
He jerked his head back at Muller’s. “Well, it’s a milestone,” he said. “Nearly all the old-timers
gone. When Fartin’ Jenny goes that’ll be the end. And Jen-ny’s getting along.”
Joe was restless. He wanted to get away—and Alf knew he did. Alf was an expert in people who
wanted to get away from him. Come to think of it, maybe that is why he carried his bag of stories.
No one really went away when he could hear some juicy stuff about someone. Everybody is a
gossip at heart. Alf was not liked for his gift but he was listened to. And he knew that Joe was on
the point of making an excuse and getting out. It occurred to. him that he didn’t know much
about Kate’s place lately. Joe might trade him some new stuff for some old stuff. “The old days
was pretty good,” he said. “ ’Course you’re just a kid.”
“I got to meet a fella,” said Joe.
Alf pretended not to hear him. “You take Faye,” he said. “She was a case,” and, parenthetically,
“You know Faye run Kate’s place. Nobody really knows how Kate come to own it. It was pretty
mysterious, and there was some that had their suspicions.” He saw with satisfaction that the fella
Joe was going to meet would wait a long time.
“What was they suspicious about?” Joe asked.
“Hell, you know how people talk. Probably nothing in it. But I got to admit it looked kind of
funny.”
“Like to have a beer?” Joe asked.
“Now you got something there,” said Alf. “They say a fella jumps from a funeral to the bedroom.
I ain’t as young as I was. Funeral makes me thirsty. The Nigger was quite a citizen. I could tell
you stuff about her. I’ve knew her for thirty-five—no, thirty-seven years.”
“Who was Faye?” Joe asked.
They went into Mr. Griffin’s saloon. Mr. Griffin didn’t like anything about liquor, and he hated
drunks with a deadly scorn. He owned and operated Griffin’s Saloon on Main Street, and on a
Saturday night he might refuse to serve twenty men he thought had had enough. The result was
that he got the best trade in his cool, orderly, quiet place. It was a saloon in which to make deals
and to talk quietly without interruption.
Joe and Alf sat at the round table at the back and had three beers apiece. Joe learned everything
true and untrue, founded and unfounded, every ugly conjecture. Out of it he got complete
confusion but a few ideas. Something might have been not exactly on the level about the death of
Faye. Kate might be the wife of Adam Trask. He hid that quickly—Trask might want to pay off.
The Faye thing might be too hot to touch. Joe had to think about that—alone.
At the end of a couple of hours Alf was restive. Joe had not played ball. He had traded nothing,

not one single piece of information or guess. Alf found himself thinking, Fella that closemouthed must have something to hide. Wonder who would have a line on him?
Alf said finally, “Understand, I like Kate. She gives me a job now and then and she’s generous
and quick to pay. Probably nothing to all the palaver about her. Still, when you think of it, she’s a
pretty cold piece of woman. She’s got a real bad eye. You think?”
“I get along fine,” said Joe.
Alf was angry at Joe’s perfidy, so he put in a needle. “I had a funny idea,” he said. “It was when I
built that lean-to without no window. She laid that cold eye on me one day and the idea come to
me. If she knew all the things I heard, and she was to offer me a drink or even a cupcake—why,
I’d say, ‘No thank you, ma’am,’ ”
“Me and her get along just fine,” said Joe. “I got to meet a guy.”
Joe went to his room to think. He was uneasy. He jumped up and looked in his suitcase and
opened all the bureau drawers. He thought somebody had been going through his things. Just
came to him. There was nothing to find. It made him nervous. He tried to arrange the things he
had heard.
There was a tap on the door and Thelma came in, her eyes swollen and her nose red. “What’s got
into Kate?”
“She’s been sick.”
“I don’t mean that. I was in the kitchen shaking up a milkshake in a fruit jar and she came in and
worked me over.”
“Was you maybe shaking up a little bourbon in it?”
“Hell, no. Just vanilla extract. She can’t talk like that to me.”
“She did, didn’t she?”
“Well, I won’t take it.”
“Oh, yes, you will,” said Joe. “Get out, Thelma!”
Thelma looked at him out of her dark, handsome, brooding eyes, and she regained the island of
safety a woman depends on. “Joe,” she asked, “are you really just pure son of a bitch or do you
just pretend to be?”
“What do you care?” Joe asked.
“I don’t,” said Thelma. “You son of a bitch.”

2
Joe planned to move slowly, cautiously, and only after long consideration. “I got the breaks, I got
to use ’em right,” he told himself.
He went in to get his evening orders and took them from the back of Kate’s head. She was at her
desk, green eyeshade low, and she did not look around at him. She finished her terse orders and
then went on, “Joe, I wonder if you’ve been attending to business. I’ve been sick. But I’m well
again or very nearly well.”
“Something wrong?”
“Just a symptom. I’d rather Thelma drank whisky than vanilla extract, and I don’t want her to

drink whisky. I think you’ve been slipping.”
His mind scurried for a hiding place. “Well, I been busy,” he said.
“Busy?”
“Sure. Doing that stuff for you.”
“What stuff?”
“You know—about Ethel.”
“Forget Ethel!”
“Okay,” said Joe. And then it came without his expecting it. “I met a fella yesterday said he seen
her.”
If Joe had not known her he would not have given the little pause, the rigid ten seconds of
silence, its due.
At the end of it Kate asked softly, “Where?”
“Here.”
She turned her swivel chair slowly around to face him. “I shouldn’t have let you work in the dark,
Joe. It’s hard to confess a fault but I owe it to you. I don’t have to remind you I got Ethel floated
out of the county. I thought she’d done something to me.” A melancholy came into her voice. “I
was wrong. I found out later. It’s been working on me ever since. She didn’t do anything to me. I
want to find her and make it up to her. I guess you think it’s strange for me to feel that way.”
“No, ma’am.”
“Find her for me, Joe. I’ll feel better when I’ve made it up to her—the poor old girl.”
“I’ll try, ma’am.”
“And, Joe—if you need any money, let me know. And if you find her, just tell her what I said. If
she doesn’t want to come here, find out where I can tele-phone her. Need any money?”
“Not right now, ma’am. But I’ll have to go out of the house more than I ought.”
“You go ahead. That’s all, Joe.”
He wanted to hug himself. In the hall he gripped his elbows and let his joy run through him. And
he began to believe he had planned the whole thing. He went through the darkened parlor with its
low early evening spatter of conversation. He stepped outside and looked up at the stars
swimming in schools through the wind-driven clouds.
Joe thought of his bumbling father—because he remembered something the old man had told
him. “Look out for a soup carrier,” Joe’s father had said. “Take one of them dames that’s always
carrying soup to somebody—she wants something, and don’t you forget it.”
Joe said under his breath, “A soup carrier. I thought she was smarter than that.” He went over her
tone and words to make sure he hadn’t missed something. No—a soup carrier. And he thought of
Alf saying, “If she was to offer a drink or even a cupcake—”

3
Kate sat at her desk. She could hear the wind in the tall privet in the yard, and the wind and the
darkness were full of Ethel—fat, sloppy Ethel oozing near like a jellyfish. A dull weariness came
over her.

She went into the lean-to, the gray room, and closed the door and sat in the darkness, listening to
the pain creep back into her fingers. Her temples beat with pounding blood. She felt for the
capsule hanging in its tube on the chain around her neck, she rubbed the metal tube, warm from
her breast, against her cheek, and her courage came back. She washed her face and put on makeup, combed and puffed her hair in a loose pompadour. She moved into the hall and at the door of
the parlor she paused, as always, listening.
To the right of the door two girls and a man were talking. As soon as Kate stepped inside the talk
stopped instantly. Kate said, “Helen, I want to see you if you aren’t busy right now.”
The girl followed her down the hall and into her room. She was a pale blond with a skin like
clean and polished bone. “Is something the matter, Miss Kate?” she asked fearfully.
“Sit down. No. Nothing’s the matter. You went to the Nigger’s funeral.”
“Didn’t you want me to?”
“I don’t care about that. You went.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Tell me about it.”
“What about it?”
“Tell me what you remember—how it was.”
Helen said nervously, “Well, it was kind of awful and—kind of beautiful.”
“How do you mean?”
“I don’t know. No flowers, no nothing, but there was—there was a—well, a kind of—dignity.
The Nig-ger was just laying there in a black wood coffin with the biggest goddam silver handles.
Made you feel—I can’t say it. I don’t know how to say it.”
“Maybe you said it. What did she wear?”
“Wear, ma’am?”
“Yes—wear. They didn’t bury her naked, did they?”
A struggle of effort crossed Helen’s face. “I don’t know,” she said at last. “I don’t remember.”
“Did you go to the cemetery?”
“No, ma’am. Nobody did—except him.”
“Who?”
“Her man.”
Kate said quickly—almost too quickly, “Have you got any regulars tonight?”
“No, ma’am. Day before Thanksgiving. Bound to be slow.”
“I’d forgotten,” said Kate. “Get back out.” She watched the girl out of the room and moved
restlessly back to her desk. And as she looked at an itemized bill for plumbing her left hand
strayed to her neck and touched the chain. It was comfort and reassurance.

Chapter 49

Both Lee and Cal tried to argue Adam out of going to meet the train, the Lark night train from
San Francisco to Los Angeles.
Cal said, “Why don’t we let Abra go alone? He’ll want to see her first.”
“I think he won’t know anybody else is there,” said Lee. “So it doesn’t matter whether we go or
not.”
“I want to see him get off the train,” said Adam. “He’ll be changed. I want to see what change
there is.”
Lee said, “He’s only been gone a couple of months. He can’t be very changed, nor much older.”
“He’ll be changed. Experience will do that.”
“If you go we’ll all have to go,” said Cal.
“Don’t you want to see your brother?” Adam asked sternly.
“Sure, but he won’t want to see me—not right at first.”
“He will too,” said Adam. “Don’t you underrate Aron.”
Lee threw up his hands. “I guess we all go,” he said.
“Can you imagine?” said Adam. “He’ll know so many new things. I wonder if he’ll talk different.
You know, Lee, in the East a boy takes on the speech of his school. You can tell a Harvard man
from a Princeton man. At least that’s what they say.”
“I’ll listen,” said Lee. “I wonder what dialect they speak at Stanford. “ He smiled at Cal.
Adam didn’t think it was funny. “Did you put some fruit in his room?” he asked. “He loves fruit.”
“Pears and apples and muscat grapes,” said Lee.
“Yes, he loves muscats. I remember he loves mus-cats.”
Under Adam’s urging they got to the Southern Pacific Depot half an hour before the train was
due. Abra was already there.
“I can’t come to dinner tomorrow, Lee,” she said. “My father wants me home. I’ll come as soon
after as I can.”
“You’re a little breathless,” said Lee.
“Aren’t you?”
“I guess I am,” said Lee. “Look up the track and see if the block’s turned green.”
Train schedules are a matter of pride and of appre-hension to nearly everyone. When, far up the
track, the block signal snapped from red to green and the long, stabbing probe of the headlight
sheered the bend and blared on the station, men looked at their watches and said, “On time.”
There was pride in it, and relief too. The split second has been growing more and more important
to us. And as human activities become more and more intermeshed and integrated, the split tenth

of a second will emerge, and then a new name must be made for the split hundredth, until one
day, although I don’t believe it, we’ll say, “Oh, the hell with it. What’s wrong with an hour?” But
it isn’t silly, this preoccupation with small time units. One thing late or early can disrupt everything around it, and the disturbance runs outward in bands like the waves from a dropped stone in
a quiet pool.
The Lark came rushing in as though it had no intention of stopping. And only when the engine
and baggage cars were well past did the air brakes give their screaming hiss and the straining iron
protest to a halt.
The train delivered quite a crowd for Salinas, return-ing relatives home for Thanksgiving, their
hands entan-gled in cartons and gift-wrapped paper boxes. It was a moment or two before his
family could locate Aron. And then they saw him, and he seemed bigger than he had been.
He was wearing a flat-topped, narrow-brimmed hat, very stylish, and when he saw them he broke
into a run and yanked off his hat, and they could see that his bright hair was clipped to a short
brush of a pompadour that stood straight up. And his eyes shone so that they laughed with
pleasure to see him.
Aron dropped his suitcase and lifted Abra from the ground in a great hug. He set her down and
gave Adam and Cal his two hands. He put his arms around Lee’s shoulders and nearly crushed
him.
On the way home they all talked at once. “Well, how are you?”
“You look fine.”
“Abra, you’re so pretty.”
“I am not. Why did you cut your hair?”
“Oh, everybody wears it that way,”
“But you have such nice hair.”
They hurried up to Main Street and one short block and around the corner on Central past
Reynaud’s with stacked French bread in the window and black-haired Mrs. Reynaud waved her
flour-pale hand at them and they were home.
Adam said, “Coffee, Lee?”
“I made it before we left. It’s on the simmer.” He had the cups laid out too. Suddenly they were
together—Aron and Abra on the couch, Adam in his chair un-der the light, Lee passing coffee,
and Cal braced in the doorway to the hall. And they were silent, for it was too late to say hello
and too early to begin other things.
Adam did say, “I’ll want to hear all about it. Will you get good marks?”
“Finals aren’t until next month, Father.”
“Oh, I see. Well, you’ll get good marks, all right. I’m sure you will.”
In spite of himself a grimace of impatience crossed Aron’s face.
“I’ll bet you’re tired,” said Adam. “Well, we can talk tomorrow.”
Lee said, “I’ll bet he’s not. I’ll bet he’d like to be alone.”
Adam looked at Lee and said, “Why, of course—of course. Do you think we should all go to
bed?”

Abra solved it for them. “I can’t stay out long,” she said. “Aron, why don’t you walk me home?
We’ll be together tomorrow.”
On the way Aron clung to her arm. He shivered. “There’s going to a frost,” he said.
“You’re glad to be back.”
“Yes, I am. I have a lot to talk about.”
“Good things?”
“Maybe. I hope you think so.”
“You sound serious.”
“It is serious.”
“When do you have to go back?”
“Not until Sunday night.”
“We’ll have lots of time. I want to tell you some things too. We have tomorrow and Friday and
Saturday and all day Sunday. Would you mind not coming in tonight?”
“Why not?”
“I’ll tell you later.”
“I want to know now.”
“Well, my father’s got one of his streaks.”
“Against me?”
“Yes. I can’t go to dinner with you tomorrow, but I won’t eat much at home, so you can tell Lee
to save a plate for me.”
He was turning shy. She could feel it in the relaxing grip on her arm and in his silence, and she
could see it in his raised face. “I shouldn’t have told you that tonight.”
“Yes, you should,” he said slowly. “Tell me the truth. Do you still—want to be with me?”
“Yes, I do.”
“Then all right. I’ll go away now. We’ll talk tomor-row.”
He left her on her porch with the feeling of a light-brushed kiss on her lips. She felt hurt that he
had agreed so easily, and she laughed sourly at herself that she could ask a thing and be hurt
when she got it. She watched his tall quick step through the radiance of the corner streetlight. She
thought, I must be crazy. I’ve been imagining things.

2
In his bedroom after he had said his good night, Aron sat on the edge of his bed and peered down
at his hands cupped between his knees. He felt let down and helpless, packed like a bird’s egg in
the cotton of his father’s ambition for him. He had not known its strength until tonight, and he
wondered whether he would have the strength to break free of its soft, persis-tent force. His
thoughts would not coagulate. The house seemed cold with a dampness that made him shiver. He
got up and softly opened his door. There was a light under Cal’s door. He tapped and went in
without wait-ing for a reply.
Cal sat at a new desk. He was working with tissue paper and a bolt of red ribbon, and as Aron
came in he hastily covered something on his desk with a large blotter.

Aron smiled. “Presents?”
“Yes,” said Cal and left it at that.
“Can I talk to you?”
“Sure! Come on in. Talk low or Father will come in. He hates to miss a moment.”
Aron sat down on the bed. He was silent so long that Cal asked, “What’s the matter—you got
trouble?”
“No, not trouble. I just wanted to talk to you. Cal, I don’t want to go on at college.”
Cal’s head jerked around. “You don’t? Why not?”
“I just don’t like it.”
“You haven’t told Father, have you? He’ll be disap-pointed. It’s bad enough that I don’t want to
go. What do you want to do?”
“I thought I’d like to take over the ranch.”
“How about Abra?”
“She told me a long time ago that’s what she’d like.”
Cal studied him. “The ranch has got a lease to run.”
“Well, I was just thinking about it.”
Cal said, “There’s no money in farming.”
“I don’t want much money. Just to get along.”
“That’s not good enough for me,” said Cal. “I want a lot of money and I’m going to get it too.”
“How?”
Cal felt older and surer than his brother. He felt protective toward him. “If you’ll go on at college,
why, I’ll get started and lay in a foundation. Then when you finish we can be partners. I’ll have
one kind of thing and you’ll have another. That might be pretty good.”
“I don’t want to go back. Why do I have to go back?”
“Because Father wants you to.”
“That won’t make me go.”
Cal stared fiercely at his brother, at the pale hair and the wide-set eyes, and suddenly he knew
why his father loved Aron, knew it beyond doubt. “Sleep on it,” he said quickly. “It would be
better if you finish out the term at least. Don’t do anything now.”
Aron got up and moved toward the door. “Who’s the present for?” he asked.
“It’s for Father. You’ll see it tomorrow—after din-ner.”
“It’s not Christmas.”
“No,” said Cal, “it’s better than Christmas.”
When Aron had gone back to his room Cal uncov-ered his present. He counted the fifteen new
bills once more, and they were so crisp they made a sharp, crack-ing sound. The Monterey
County Bank had to send to San Francisco to get them, and only did so when the reason for them
was told. It was a matter of shock and disbelief to the bank that a seventeen-year-old boy should,
first, own them, and, second, carry them about. Bankers do not like money to be lightly handled
even if the handling is sentimental. It had taken Will Hamil-ton’s word to make the bank believe
that the money belonged to Cal, that it was honestly come by, and that he could do what he

wanted to with it.
Cal wrapped the bills in tissue and tied it with red ribbon finished in a blob that was faintly
recognizable as a bow. The package might have been a handker-chief. He concealed it under the
shirts in his bureau and went to bed. But he could not sleep. He was excited and at the same time
shy. He wished the day was over and the gift given. He went over what he planned to say.
“This is for you.”
“What is it?”
“A present.”
From then on he didn’t know what would happen. He tossed and rolled in bed, and at dawn he
got up and dressed and crept out of the house.
On Main Street he saw Old Martin sweeping the street with a stable broom. The city council was
dis-cussing the purchase of a mechanical sweeper. Old Martin hoped he would get to drive it, but
he was cynical about it. Young men got the cream of every-thing. Bacigalupi’s garbage wagon
went by, and Martin looked after it spitefully. There was a good business. Those wops were
getting rich.
Main Street was empty except for a few dogs sniffing at closed entrances and the sleepy activity
around the San Francisco Chop House. Pet Bulene’s new taxi was parked in front, for Pet had
been alerted the night before to take the Williams girls to the morning train for San Francisco.
Old Martin called to Cal, “Got a cigarette, young fella?”
Cal stopped and took out his cardboard box of Murads.
“Oh, fancy ones!” Martin said. “I ain’t got a match either.”
Cal lighted the cigarette for him, careful not to set fire to the grizzle around Martin’s mouth.
Martin leaned on the handle of his brush and puffed disconsolately. “Young fellas gets the
cream,” he said. “They won’t let me drive it.”
“What?” Cal asked.
“Why, the new sweeper. Ain’t you heard? Where you been, boy?” It was incredible to him that
any reason-ably informed human did not know about the sweeper. He forgot Cal. Maybe the
Bacigalupis would give him a job. They were coining money. Three wagons and a new truck.
Cal turned down Alisal Street, went into the post office, and looked in the glass window of box
632. It was empty. He wandered back home and found Lee up and stuffing a very large turkey.
“Up all night?” Lee asked.
“No. I just went for a walk.”
“Nervous?”
“Yes.”
“I don’t blame you. I would be too. It’s hard to give people things—I guess it’s harder to be given
things, though. Seems silly, doesn’t it? Want some coffee?”
“I don’t mind.”
Lee wiped his hands and poured coffee for himself and for Cal. “How do you think Aron looks?”
“All right, I guess.”
“Did you get to talk to him?”

“No,” said Cal. It was easier that way. Lee would want to know what he said. It wasn’t Aron’s
day. It was Cal’s day. He had carved this day out for himself and he wanted it. He meant to have
it.
Aron came in, his eyes still misty with sleep. “What time do you plan to have dinner, Lee?”
“Oh, I don’t know—three-thirty or four.”
“Could you make it about five?”
“I guess so, if Adam says it’s all right. Why?”
“Well, Abra can’t get here before then. I’ve got a plan I want to put to my father and I want her to
be here.”
“I guess that will be all right,” said Lee.
Cal got up quickly and went to his room. He sat at his desk with the student light turned on and
he churned with uneasiness and resentment. Without effort, Aron was taking his day away from
him. It would turn out to be Aron’s day. Then, suddenly, he was bitterly ashamed. He covered his
eyes with his hands and he said, “It’s just jealousy. I’m jealous. That’s what I am. I’m jealous. I
don’t want to be jealous.” And he repeated over and over, “Jealous—jealous—jealous,” as though
bringing it into the open might destroy it. And having gone this far, he proceed-ed with his selfpunishment. “Why am I giving the money to my father? Is it for his good? No. It’s for my good.
Will Hamilton said it—I’m trying to buy him. There’s not one decent thing about it. There’s not
one decent thing about me. I sit here wallowing in jealousy of my brother. Why not call things by
their names?”
He whispered hoarsely to himself. “Why not be hon-est? I know why my father loves Aron. It’s
because he looks like her. My father never got over her. He may not know it, but it’s true. I
wonder if he does know it. That makes me jealous of her too. Why don’t I take my money and go
away? They wouldn’t miss me. In a little while they’d forget I ever existed—all except Lee. And
I wonder whether Lee likes me. Maybe not.” He dou-bled his fists against his forehead. “Does
Aron have to fight himself like this? I don’t think so, but how do I know? I could ask him. He
wouldn’t say.”
Cal’s mind careened in anger at himself and in pity for himself. And then a new voice came into
it, saying coolly and with contempt, “If you’re being honest—why not say you are enjoying this
beating you’re giving yourself? That would be the truth. Why not be just what you are and do just
what you do?” Cal sat in shock from this thought. Enjoying?—of course. By whipping himself he
protected himself against whipping by someone else. His mind tightened up. Give the money, but
give it lightly. Don’t depend on anything. Don’t foresee anything. Just give it and forget it. And
forget it now. Give—give. Give the day to Aron. Why not? He jumped up and hurried out to the
kitchen.
Aron was holding open the skin of the turkey while Lee forced stuffing into the cavity. The oven
cricked and snapped with growing heat.
Lee said, “Let’s see, eighteen pounds, twenty minutes to the pound—that’s eighteen times twenty
—that’s three hundred and sixty minutes, six hours even—eleven to twelve, twelve to one—” He
counted on his fingers.

Cal said, “When you get through, Aron, let’s take a walk.”
“Where to?” Aron asked.
“Just around town. I want to ask you something.”
Cal led his brother across the street to Berges and Garrisiere, who imported fine wines and
liquors. Cal said, “I’ve got a little money, Aron. I thought you might like to buy some wine for
dinner. I’ll give you the money.”
“What kind of wine?”
“Let’s make a real celebration. Let’s get champagne—it can be your present.”
Joe Garrisiere said, “You boys aren’t old enough.”
“For dinner? Sure we are.”
“Can’t sell it to you. I’m sorry.”
Cal said, “I know what you can do. We can pay for it and you can send it to our father.”
“That I can do,” Joe Garrisiere said. “We’ve got some Oeil de Perdrix—” His lips pursed as
though he were tasting it.
“What’s that?” Cal asked.
“Champagne—but very pretty, same color as a par-tridge eye—pink but a little darker than pink,
and dry too. Four-fifty a bottle.”
“Isn’t that high?” Aron asked.
“Sure it’s high!” Cal laughed. “Send three bottles over, Joe.” To Aron he said, “It’s your present.”

To Cal the day was endless. He wanted to leave the house and couldn’t. At eleven o’clock Adam
went to the closed draft-board office to brood over the records of a new batch of boys coming up.
Aron seemed perfectly calm. He sat in the living room, looking at cartoons in old numbers of the
Review of Reviews. From the kitchen the odor of the bursting juices of roasting turkey began to
fill the house.
Cal went into his room and took out his present and laid it on his desk. He tried to write a card to
put on it. “To my father from Caleb”—“To Adam Trask from Caleb Trask.” He tore the cards in
tiny pieces and flushed them down the toilet.
He thought, Why give it to him today? Maybe to-morrow I could go to him quietly and say, This
is for you, and then walk away. That would be easier. “No,” he said aloud. “I want the others to
see.” It had to be that way. But his lungs were compressed and the palms of his hands were wet
with stage fright. And then he thought of the morning when his father got him out of jail. The
warmth and closeness—they were the things to remember—and his father’s trust. Why, he had
even said it. “I trust you.” He felt much better then.
At about three o’clock he heard Adam come in and there was the low sound of voices conversing
in the living room. Cal joined his father and Aron.
Adam was saying, “The times are changed. A boy must be a specialist or he will get nowhere. I
guess that’s why I’m so glad you’re going to college.”
Aron said, “I’ve been thinking about that, and I wonder.”

“Well, don’t think any more. Your first choice is right. Look at me. I know a little bit about a
great many things and not enough about any one of them to make a living in these times.”
Cal sat down quietly. Adam did not notice him. His face was concentrated on his thought.
“It’s natural for a man to want his son to succeed,” Adam went on. “And maybe I can see better
than you can.”
Lee looked in. “The kitchen scales must be way off,” he said. “The turkey’s going to be done
earlier than the chart says. I’ll bet that bird doesn’t weigh eighteen pounds.”
Adam said, “Well, you can keep it warm,” and he continued, “Old Sam Hamilton saw this
coming. He said there couldn’t be any more universal philosophers. The weight of knowledge is
too great for one mind to absorb. He saw a time when one man would know only one little
fragment, but he would know it well.”
“Yes,” Lee said from the doorway, “and he deplored it. He hated it.”
“Did he now?” Adam asked.
Lee came into the room. He held his big basting spoon in his right hand, and he cupped his left
under the bowl for fear it would drip on the carpet. He came into the room and forgot and waved
his spoon and drops of turkey fat fell to the floor. “Now you question it, I don’t know,” he said.
“I don’t know whether he hated it or I hate it for him.”
“Don’t get so excited,” said Adam. “Seems to me we can’t discuss anything any more but you
take it as a personal insult.”
“Maybe the knowledge is too great and maybe men are growing too small,” said Lee. “Maybe,
kneeling down to atoms, they’re becoming atom-sized in their souls. Maybe a specialist is only a
coward, afraid to look out of his little cage. And think what any special-ist misses—the whole
world over his fence.”
“We’re only talking about making a living.”
“A living—or money,” Lee said excitedly. “Money’s easy to make if it’s money you want. But
with a few exceptions people don’t want money. They want lux-ury and they want love and they
want admiration.”
“All right. But do you have any objection to college? That’s what we’re talking about.”
“I’m sorry,” said Lee. “You’re right, I do seem to get too excited. No, if college is where a man
can go to find his relation to his whole world, I don’t object. Is it that? Is it that, Aron?”
“I don’t know,” said Aron.
A hissing sound came from the kitchen. Lee said, “The goddam giblets are boiling over,” and he
bolted through the door.
Adam gazed after him affectionately. “What a good man! What a good friend!”
Aron said, “I hope he lives to be a hundred.”
His father chuckled. “How do you know he’s not a hundred now?”
Cal asked, “How is the ice plant doing, Father?”
“Why, all right. Pays for itself and makes a little profit. Why?”
“I thought of a couple of things to make it really pay.”
“Not today,” said Adam quickly. “Monday, if you remember, but not today. You know,” Adam

said, “I don’t remember when I’ve felt so good. I feel—well, you might call it fulfilled. Maybe
it’s only a good night’s sleep and a good trip to the bathroom. And maybe it’s because we’re all
together and at peace.” He smiled at Aron. “We didn’t know what we felt about you until you
went away.”
“I was homesick,” Aron confessed. “The first few days I thought I’d die of it.”
Abra came in with a little rush. Her cheeks were pink and she was happy. “Did you notice there’s
snow on Mount Toro?” she asked.
“Yes, I saw it,” Adam said. “They say that means a good year to come. And we could use it.”
“I just nibbled,” said Abra. “I wanted to be hungry for here.”
Lee apologized for the dinner like an old fool. He blamed the gas oven which didn’t heat like a
good wood stove. He blamed the new breed of turkeys which lacked a something turkeys used to
have. But he laughed with them when they told him he was acting like an old woman fishing for
compliments.
With the plum pudding Adam opened the cham-pagne, and they treated it with ceremony. A
courtliness settled over the table. They proposed toasts. Each one had his health drunk, and Adam
made a little speech to Abra when he drank her health.
Her eyes were shining and under the table Aron held her hand. The wine dulled Cal’s
nervousness and he was not afraid about his present.
When Adam had finished his plum pudding he said, “I guess we never have had such a good
Thanksgiv-ing.”
Cal reached in his jacket pocket, took out the red-ribboned package, and pushed it over in front of
his father.
“What’s this?” Adam asked.
“It’s a present.”
Adam was pleased. “Not even Christmas and we have presents. I wonder what it can be!”
“A handkerchief,” said Abra.
Adam slipped off the grubby bow and unfolded the tissue paper. He stared down at the money.
Abra said, “What is it?” and stood up to look. Aron leaned forward. Lee, in the doorway, tried to
keep the look of worry from his face. He darted a glance at Cal and saw the light of joy and
triumph in his eyes.
Very slowly Adam moved his fingers and fanned the gold certificates. His voice seemed to come
from far away. “What is it? What—” He stopped.
Cal swallowed. “It’s—I made it—to give to you—to make up for losing the lettuce.”
Adam raised his head slowly. “You made it? How?”
“Mr. Hamilton—we made it—on beans.” He hurried on, “We bought futures at five cents and
when the price jumped—It’s for you, fifteen thousand dollars. It’s for you.”
Adam touched the new bills so that their edges came together, folded the tissue over them and
turned the ends up. He looked helplessly at Lee. Cal caught a feeling—a feeling of calamity, of
destruction in the air, and a weight of sickness overwhelmed him. He heard his father say,
“You’ll have to give it back.”

Almost as remotely his own voice said, “Give it back? Give it back to who?”
“To the people you got it from.”
“The British Purchasing Agency? They can’t take it back. They’re paying twelve and a half cents
for beans all over the country.”
“Then give it to the farmers you robbed.”
“Robbed?” Cal cried. “Why, we paid them two cents a pound over the market. We didn’t rob
them.” Cal felt suspended in space, and time seemed very slow.
His father took a long time to answer. There seemed to be long spaces between his words. “I send
boys out,” he said. “I sign my name and they go out. And some will die and some will lie helpless
without arms and legs. Not one will come back untorn. Son, do you think I could take a profit on
that?”
“I did it for you,”. Cal said. “I wanted you to have the money to make up your loss.”
“I don’t want the money, Cal. And the lettuce—I don’t think I did that for a profit. It was a kind
of game to see if I could get the lettuce there, and I lost. I don’t want the money.”
Cal looked straight ahead. He could feel the eyes of Lee and Aron and Abra crawling on his
cheeks. He kept his eyes on his father’s lips.
“I like the idea of a present,” Adam went on. “I thank you for the thought—”
“I’ll put it away. I’ll keep it for you,” Cal broke in.
“No. I won’t want it ever. I would have been so happy if you could have given me—well, what
your brother has—pride in the thing he’s doing, gladness in his progress. Money, even clean
money, doesn’t stack up with that.” His eyes widened a little and he said, “Have I made you
angry, son? Don’t be angry. If you want to give me a present—give me a good life. That would
be something I could value.”
Cal felt that he was choking. His forehead streamed with perspiration and he tasted salt on his
tongue. He stood up suddenly and his chair fell over. He ran from the room, holding his breath.
Adam called after him, “Don’t be angry, son.”
They let him alone. He sat in his room, his elbows on his desk. He thought he would cry but he
did not. He tried to let weeping start but tears could not pass the hot iron in his head.
After a time his breathing steadied and he watched his brain go to work slyly, quietly. He fought
the quiet hateful brain down and it slipped aside and went about its work. He fought it more
weakly, for hate was seep-ing all through his body, poisoning every nerve. He could feel himself
losing control.
Then there came a point where the control and the fear were gone and his brain cried out in an
aching triumph. His hand went to a pencil and he drew tight little spirals one after another on his
blotting pad. When Lee came in an hour later there were hundreds of spirals, and they had
become smaller and smaller. He did not look up.
Lee closed the door gently. “I brought you some coffee,” he said.
“I don’t want it—yes, I do. Why, thank you, Lee. It’s kind of you to think of it.”
Lee said, “Stop it! Stop it, I tell you!”
“Stop what? What do you want me to stop?”

Lee said uneasily, “I told you once when you asked me that it was all in yourself. I told you you
could control it—if you wanted.”
“Control what? I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Lee said, “Can’t you hear me? Can’t I get through to you? Cal, don’t you know what I’m saying?”
“I hear you, Lee. What are you saying?”
“He couldn’t help it, Cal. That’s his nature. It was the only way he knew. He didn’t have any
choice. But you have. Don’t you hear me? You have a choice.”
The spirals had become so small that the pencil lines ran together and the result was a shiny black
dot.
Cal said quietly, “Aren’t you making a fuss about nothing? You must be slipping. You’d think
from your tone that I’d killed somebody. Come off it, Lee. Come off it.”
It was silent in the room. After a moment Cal turned from his desk and the room was empty. A
cup of coffee on the bureau top sent up a plume of vapor. Cal drank the coffee scalding as it was
and went into the living room.
His father looked up apologetically at him.
Cal said, “I’m sorry, Father. I didn’t know how you felt about it.” He took the package of money
from where it lay on the mantel and put it in the inside pocket of his coat where it had been
before. “I’ll see what I can do about this.” He said casually, “Where are the others?”
“Oh, Abra had to go. Aron walked with her. Lee went out.”
“I guess I’ll go for a walk,” said Cal.

The November night was well fallen. Cal opened the front door a crack and saw Lee’s shoulders
and head outlined against the white wall of the French Laundry across the street. Lee was sitting
on the steps, and he looked lumpy in his heavy coat.
Cal closed the door quietly and went back through the living room. “Champagne makes you
thirsty,” he said. His father didn’t look up.
Cal slipped out the kitchen door and moved through Lee’s waning kitchen garden. He climbed
the high fence, found the two-by-twelve plank that served as a bridge across the slough of dark
water, and came out between Lang’s Bakery and the tinsmith’s shop on Castroville Street.
He walked to Stone Street where the Catholic church is and turned left, went past the Carriaga
house, the Wilson house, the Zabala house, and turned left on Central Avenue at the Steinbeck
house. Two blocks out Central he turned left past the West End School.
The poplar trees in front of the schoolyard were nearly bare, but in the evening wind a few
yellowed leaves still twisted down.
Cal’s mind was numb. He did not even know that the air was cold with frost slipping down from
the mountains. Three blocks ahead he saw his brother cross under a streetlight, coming toward
him. He knew it was his brother by stride and posture and because he knew it.
Cal slowed his steps, and when Aron was close he said, “Hi. I came looking for you.”
Aron said, “I’m sorry about this afternoon.”

“You couldn’t help it—forget it.” He turned and the two walked side by side. “I want you to
come with me,” Cal said. “I want to show you something.”
“What is it?”
“Oh, it’s a surprise. But it’s very interesting. You’ll be interested.”
“Well, will it take long?”
“No, not very long. Not very long at all.”
They walked past Central Avenue toward Castroville Street.

Sergeant Axel Dane ordinarily opened the San Jose recruiting office at eight o’clock, but if he
was a little late Corporal Kemp opened it, and Kemp was not likely to complain. Axel was not an
unusual case. A hitch in the U.S. Army in the time of peace between the Spanish war and the
German war had unfitted him for the cold, unordered life of a civilian. One month between
hitches convinced him of that. Two hitches in the peacetime army completely unfitted him for
war, and he had learned enough method to get out of it. The San Jose recruiting station proved he
knew his way about. He was dallying with the youngest Ricci girl and she lived in San Jose.
Kemp hadn’t the time in, but he was learning the basic rule. Get along with the topkick and avoid
all officers when possible. He didn’t mind the gentle riding Sergent Dane handed out.
At eight-thirty Dane entered the office to find Corpo-ral Kemp asleep at his desk and a tiredlooking kid sat waiting. Dane glanced at the boy and then went in back of the rail and put his
hand on Kemp’s shoulder.
“Darling,” he said, “the skylarks are singing and a new dawn is here.”
Kemp raised his head from his arms, wiped his nose on the back of his hand, and sneezed.
“That’s my sweet,” the sergeant said. “Arise, we have a customer.”
Kemp squinted his crusted eyes. “The war will wait,” he said.
Dane looked more closely at the boy. “God! he’s beautiful. I hope they take good care of him.
Corporal, you may think that he wants to bear arms against the foe, but I think he’s running away
from love.”
Kemp was relieved that the sergeant wasn’t quite sober. “You think some dame hurt him?” He
played any game his sergeant wished. “You think it’s the For-eign Legion?”
“Maybe he’s running away from himself.”
Kemp said, “I saw that picture. There’s one mean son of a bitch of a sergeant in it.”
“I don’t believe it,” said Dane. “Step up, young man. Eighteen, aren’t you?”
“Yes, sir.”
Dane turned to his man. “What do you think?”
“Hell!” said Kemp. “I say if they’re big enough, they’re old enough.”
The sergeant said, “Let’s say you’re eighteen. And we’ll stick to it, shall we?”
“Yes, sir.”
“You just take this form and fill it out. Now you figure out what year you were born, and you put
it down right here, and you remember it.”

Chapter 50

Joe didn’t like for Kate to sit still and stare straight ahead—hour after hour. That meant she was
thinking, and since her face had no expression Joe had no access to her thoughts. It made him
uneasy. He didn’t want his first real good break to get away from him.
He had only one plan himself—and that was to keep her stirred up until she gave herself away.
Then he could jump in any direction. But how about it if she sat looking at the wall? Was she
stirred up or wasn’t she?
Joe knew she hadn’t been to bed, and when he asked whether or not she wanted breakfast she
shook her head so slowly that it was hard to know whether she had heard him or not.
He advised, himself cautiously, “Don’t do nothing! Just stick around and keep your eyes and ears
open.” The girls in the house knew something had happened but no two of them had the same
story, the goddam chickenheads.
Kate was not thinking. Her mind drifted among impressions the way a bat drifts and swoops in
the evening. She saw the face of the blond and beautiful boy, his eyes mad with shock. She heard
his ugly words aimed not so much at her as at himself. And she saw his dark brother leaning
against the door and laughing.
Kate had laughed too—the quickest and best self-protection. What would her son do? What had
he done after he went quietly away?
She thought of Cal’s eyes with their look of sluggish and fulfilled cruelty, peering at her as he
slowly closed the door.
Why had he brought his brother? What did he want? What was he after? If she knew she could
take care of herself. But she didn’t know.
The pain was creeping in her hands again and there was a new place. Her right hip ached angrily
when she moved. She thought, So the pain will move in toward the center, and sooner or later all
the pains will meet in the center and join like rats in a clot.
In spite of his advice to himself, Joe couldn’t let it alone. He carried a pot of tea to her door,
knocked softly, opened the door, and went in. As far as he could see she hadn’t moved.
He said, “I brought you some tea, ma’am.”
“Put it on the table,” she said, and then as a second thought, “Thank you, Joe.”
“You don’t feel good, ma’am?”
“The pain’s back. The medicine fooled me.”
“Anything I can do?”
She raised her hands. “Cut these off—at the wrists.” She grimaced with the extra pain lifting her
hands had caused. “Makes you feel hopeless,” she said plaintively.

Joe had never heard a tone of weakness in her before and his instinct told him it was time to move
in. He said, “Maybe you don’t want me to bother you but I got some word about that other.” He
knew by the little interval before she answered that she had tensed.
“What other?” she asked softly.
“That dame, ma’am.”
“Oh! You mean Ethel!”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“I’m getting tired of Ethel. What is it now?”
“Well, I’ll tell you like it happened. I can’t make nothing out of it. I’m in Kellogg’s cigar store
and a fella come up to me. ‘You’re Joe?’ he says, an’ I tell him, ‘Who says?’ ‘You was lookin’
for somebody,’ he says. ‘Tell me about it,’ I says. Never seen the guy before. So he says, ‘That
party toi’ me she wants to talk to you.’ An’ I told him, ‘Well, why don’t she?’ He gives me the
long look an’ he says, ‘Maybe you forgot what the judge said.’ I guess he means about her
coming back.” He looked at Kate’s face, still and pale, the eyes looking straight ahead.
Kate said, “And then he asked you for some money?”
“No, ma’am. He didn’t. He says something don’t make no sense. He says, ‘Does Faye mean
anything to you?’ ‘Not a thing,’ I tol’ him. He says, ‘Maybe you better talk to her.’ ‘Maybe,’ I
says, an’ I come away. Don’t make no sense to me. I figured I’d ask you.”
Kate asked, “Does the name Faye mean anything to you?”
“Not a thing.”
Her voice became very soft. “You mean you never heard that Faye used to own this house?”
Joe felt a sickening jolt in the pit of his stomach. What a goddam fool! Couldn’t keep his mouth
shut. His mind floundered. “Why—why come to think of it, I believe I did hear that—seemed
like the name was like Faith.”
The sudden alarm was good for Kate. It took the blond head and the pain from her. It gave her
some-thing to do. She responded to the challenge with some-thing like pleasure.
She laughed softly. “Faith,” she said under her breath. “Pour me some tea, Joe.”
She did not appear to notice that his hand shook and that the teapot spout rattled against the cup.
She did not look at him even when he set the cup before her and then stepped back out of range
of her eyes. Joe was quaking with apprehension.
Kate said in a pleading voice, “Joe, do you think you could help me? If I gave you ten thousand
dollars, do you think you could fix everything up?” She waited just a second, then swung around
and looked full in his face.
His eyes were moist. She caught him licking his lips. And at her sudden move he stepped back as
though she had struck at him. Her eyes would not let him go.
“Did I catch you out, Joe?”
“I don’t know what you’re getting at, ma’am.”
“You go and figure it out—and then you come and tell me. You’re good at figuring things out.
And send Therese in, will you?”
He wanted to get out of this room where he was outpointed and outfought. He’d made a mess of

things. He wondered if he’d bollixed up the breaks. And then the bitch had the nerve to say,
“Thank you for bringing tea. You’re a nice boy.”
He wanted to slam the door, but he didn’t dare.
Kate got up stiffly, trying to avoid the pain of moving her hip. She went to her desk and slipped
out a sheet of paper. Holding the pen was difficult.
She wrote, moving her whole arm. “Dear Ralph: Tell the sheriff it wouldn’t do any harm to check
on Joe Valery’s fingerprints. You remember Joe. He works for me. Mrs. Kate.” She was folding
the paper when Therese came in, looking frightened.
“You want me? Did I do something? I tried my best. Ma’am, I ain’t been well.”
“Come here,” Kate said, and while the girl waited beside the desk Kate slowly addressed the
envelope and stamped it. “I want you to run a little errand for me,” she said. “Go to Bell’s candy
store and get a five-pound box of mixed chocolates and a one-pound box. The big one is for you
girls. Stop at Krough’s drugstore and get me two medium toothbrushes and a can of tooth powder
—you know, that can with a spout?”
“Yes, ma’am.” Therese was greatly relieved.
“You’re a good girl,” Kate went on. “I’ve had my eye on you. I’m not well, Therese. If I see that
you do this well, I’ll seriously consider putting you in charge when I go the hospital.”
“You will—are—are you going to the hospital?”
“I don’t know yet, dear. But I’ll need your help. Now here’s some money for the candy. Medium
tooth-brushes—remember.”
“Yes, ma’am. Thank you. Shall I go now?”
“Yes, and kind of creep out, will you? Don’t let the other girls know what I told you.”
“I’ll go out the back way.” She hurried toward the door.
Kate said, “I nearly forgot. Will you drop this in a mailbox?”
“Sure I will, ma’am. Sure I will. Anything else?”
“That’s all, dear.”
When the girl was gone Kate rested her arms and hands on the desk so that each crooked finger
was supported. Here it was. Maybe she had always known. She must have—but there was no
need to think of that now. She would come back to that. They would put Joe away, but there’d be
someone else, and there was al-ways Ethel. Sooner or later, sooner or later—but no need to think
about that now. She tiptoed her mind around the whole subject and back to an elusive thing that
peeped out and then withdrew. It was when she had been thinking of her yellow-haired son that
the fragment had first come to her mind. His face—hurt, bewildered, despairing—had brought it.
Then she remembered.
She was a very small girl with a face as lovely and fresh as her son’s face—a very small girl.
Most of the time she knew she was smarter and prettier than anyone else. But now and then a
lonely fear would fall upon her so that she seemed surrounded by a tree-tall forest of enemies.
Then every thought and word and look was aimed to hurt her, and she had no place to run and no
place to hide. And she would cry in panic because there was no escape and no sanctuary. Then
one day she was reading a book. She could read when she was five years old. She remembered

the book—brown, with a silver title, and the cloth was broken and the boards thick. It was Alice
in Wonderland.
Kate moved her hands slowly and lifted her weight a little from her arms. And she could see the
drawings—Alice with long straight hair. But it was the bottle which said, “Drink me” that had
changed her life. Alice had taught her that.
When the forest of her enemies surrounded her she was prepared. In her pocket she had a bottle
of sugar water and on its red-framed label she had written, “Drink me.” She would take a sip
from the bottle and she would grow smaller and smaller. Let her enemies look for her then! Cathy
would be under a leaf or looking out of an anthole, laughing. They couldn’t find her then. No
door could close her out and no door could close her in. She could walk upright under a door.
And always there was Alice to play with, Alice to love her and trust her. Alice was her friend,
always waiting to welcome her to tinyness.
All this so good—so good that it was almost worth while to be miserable. But good as it was,
there was one more thing always held in reserve. It was her threat and her safety. She had only to
drink the whole bottle and she would dwindle and disappear and cease to exist. And better than
all, when she stopped being, she never would have been. This was her darling safety. Some-times
in her bed she would drink enough of “Drink me” so that she was a dot as small as the littlest
gnat. But she had never gone clear out—never had to. That was her reserve—guarded from
everyone.
Kate shook her head sadly, remembering the cut-off little girl. She wondered why she had
forgotten that wonderful trick. It had saved her from so many disas-ters. The light filtering down
at one through a clover-leaf was glorious. Cathy and Alice walked among towering grass, arms
around each other—best friends. And Cathy never had to drink all of “Drink me” be-cause she
had Alice.
Kate put her head down on the blotter between her crooked hands. She was cold and desolate,
alone and desolate. Whatever she had done, she had been driven to do. She was different—she
had something more than other people. She raised her head and made no move to wipe her
streaming eyes. That was true. She was smart-er and stronger than other people. She had
something they lacked.
And right in the middle of her thought, Cal’s dark face hung in the air in front of her and his lips
were smiling with cruelty. The weight pressed down on her, forcing her breath out.
They had something she lacked, and she didn’t know what it was. Once she knew this, she was
ready; and once ready, she knew she had been ready for a long time—perhaps all of her life. Her
mind functioned like a wooden mind, her body moved crookedly like a badly operated
marionette, but she went steadily about her business.
It was noon—she knew from the chatter of the girls in the dining room. The slugs had only just
got up.
Kate had trouble with the doorknob and turned it finally by rolling it between her palms.
The girls choked in the middle of laughter and looked up at her. The cook came in from the
kitchen.

Kate was a sick ghost, crooked and in some way horrible. She leaned against the dining-room
wall and smiled at her girls, and her smile frightened them even more, for it was like the frame
for a scream.
“Where’s Joe?” Kate asked.
“He went out, ma’am.”
“Listen,” she said. “I’ve had no sleep for a long time. I’m going to take some medicine and sleep.
I don’t want to be disturbed, I don’t want any supper. I’ll sleep the clock around. Tell Joe I don’t
want any-body to come near me for anything until tomorrow morning. Do you understand?”
“Yes, ma’am,” they said.
“Good night, then. It’s afternoon but I mean good night.”
“Good night, ma’am,” they chorused obediently.
Kate turned and walked crabwise back to her room.
She closed her door and stood looking around, trying to form her simple procedure. She went
back to her desk. This time she forced her hand, in spite of the pain, to write plainly. “I leave
everything I have to my son Aron Trask.” She dated the sheet and signed it “Catherine Trask.”
Her fingers dwelt on the page, and then she got up and left her will face upward on the desk.
At the center table she poured cold tea into her cup and carried the cup to the gray room in the
lean-to and set it on the reading table. Then she went to her dress-ing table and combed her hair,
rubbed a little rouge all over her face, covered it lightly with powder, and put on the pale lipstick
she always used. Last she filed her nails and cleaned them.
When she closed the door to the gray room the outside light was cut off and only the reading
lamp threw its cone on the table. She arranged the pillows, patted them up, and sat down. She
leaned her head experimentally against the down pillow. She felt rather gay, as though she were
going to a party. Gingerly, she fished the chain out from her bodice, unscrewed the little tube, and
shook the capsule into her hand. She smiled at it.
“Eat me,” she said and put the capsule in her mouth.
She picked up the tea cup. “Drink me,” she said and swallowed the bitter cold tea.
She forced her mind to stay on Alice—so tiny and waiting. Other faces peered in from the sides
of her eyes—her father and mother, and Charles, and Adam, and Samuel Hamilton, and then
Aron, and she could see Cal smiling at her.
He didn’t have to speak. The glint of his eyes said, “You missed something. They had something
and you missed it.”
She thrust her mind back to Alice. In the gray wall opposite there was a nail hole. Alice would be
in there. And she would put her arm around Cathy’s waist, and Cathy would put her arm around
Alice’s waist, and they would walk away—best friends—and tiny as the head of a pin.
A warm numbness began to creep into her arms and legs. The pain was going from her hands.
Her eyelids felt heavy—very heavy. She yawned.
She thought or said or thought, “Alice doesn’t know. I’m going right on past.”
Her eyes closed and a dizzy nausea shook her. She opened her eyes and stared about in terror.
The gray room darkened and the cone of light flowed and rippled like water. And then her eyes

closed again and her fingers curled as though they held small breasts. And her heart beat
solemnly and her breathing slowed as she grew smaller and smaller and then disappeared—and
she had never been.

When Kate dismissed him Joe went to the barbershop, as he always did when he was upset. He
had his hair cut and an egg shampoo and tonic. He had a facial massage and a mud pack, and
around the edges he had his nails manicured, and he had his shoes shined. Ordi-narily this and a
new necktie set Joe up, but he was still depressed when he left the barber with a fifty-cent tip.
Kate had trapped him like a rat—caught him with his pants down. Her fast thinking left him
confused and helpless. The trick she had of leaving it to you whether she meant anything or not
was no less confusing.
The night started dully, but then sixteen members and two pledges from Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Stanford chapter, came in hilarious from a pledge hazing in San Juan. They were full of horseplay.
Florence, who smoked the cigarette in the circus, had a hard cough. Every time she tried, she
coughed and lost it. And the pony stallion had diarrhea.
The college boys shrieked and pounded each other in their amusement. And then they stole
everything that wasn’t nailed down.
After they had left, two of the girls got into a tired and monotonous quarrel, and Therese turned
up with the first symptoms of the old Joe. Oh, Christ, what a night!
And down the hall that brooding dangerous thing was silent behind its closed door. Joe stood by
the door before he went to bed and he could hear nothing. He closed the house at two-thirty and
was in bed by three—but he couldn’t sleep. He sat up in bed and read seven chapters of The
Winning of Barbara Worth, and when it was daylight he went down to the silent kitchen and
made a pot of coffee.
He rested his elbows on the table and held the coffee mug with both hands. Something had gone
wrong and Joe couldn’t figure what it was. Maybe she’d found out that Ethel was dead. He’d
have to watch his step. And then he made up his mind, and made it up firmly. He would go in to
see her at nine and he’d keep his ears open. Maybe he hadn’t heard right. Best thing would be to
lay it on the line and not be a hog. Just say he’d take a thousand bucks and get the hell out, and if
she said no he’d get the hell out anyway. He was sick of working with dames. He could get a job
dealing faro in Reno—regular hours and no dames. Maybe get himself an apartment and fix it up
—big chairs and a daven-port. No point in beating his brains out in this lousy town. Better if he
got out of the state anyway. He considered going right now—just get up from this ta-ble, climb
the stairs, two minutes to pack a suitcase, and gone. Three or four minutes at the most. Don’t tell
nobody nothing. The idea appealed to him. The breaks about Ethel might not be as good as he
thought at first, but a thousand bucks was a stake. Better wait.
When the cook came in he was in a bad mood. He had a developing carbuncle on the back of his
neck and the skin from the inside of an eggshell stretched over it to draw it to a head. He didn’t
want anybody in his kitchen feeling the way he did.

Joe went back to his room and read some more and then he packed his suitcase. He was going to
get out any way it went.
At nine o’clock he knocked gently on Kate’s door and pushed it open. Her bed had not been slept
in. He set down the tray and went to the door of the lean-to and knocked and knocked again and
then called. Finally he opened the door.
The cone of light fell on the reading stand. Kate’s head was deeply cushioned in the pillow.
“You must have slept all night here,” Joe said. He walked around in front of her, saw bloodless
lips and eyes shining dully between half-closed lids, and he knew she was dead.
He moved his head from side to side and went quickly into the other room to make sure that the
door to the hall was closed. With great speed he went through the dresser, drawer by drawer,
opened her purses, the little box by her bed—and he stood still. She didn’t have a goddam thing—
not even a silver-backed hairbrush.
He crept to the lean-to and stood in front of her—not a ring, not a pin. Then he saw the little
chain around her neck and lifted it clear and unsnapped the clasp—a small gold watch, a little
tube, and two safe-deposit keys, numbers 27 and 29.
“So that’s where you got it, you bitch,” he said.
He slipped the watch off the thin chain and put it in his pocket. He wanted to punch her in the
nose. Then he thought of her desk.
The two-line holograph will attracted him. Somebody might pay for that. He put it in his pocket.
He took a handful of papers from a pigeonhole—bills and re-ceipts; next hole, insurance; next, a
small book with records of every girl. He put that in his pocket too. He took the rubber band from
a packet of brown enve-lopes, opened one, and pulled out a photograph. On the back of the
picture, in Kate’s neat, sharp handwriting, a name and address and a title.
Joe laughed aloud. This was the real breaks. He tried another envelope and another. A gold mine
—guy could live for years on these. Look at that fat-ass councilman! He put the band back. In the
top drawer eight ten-dollar bills and a bunch of keys. He pocketed the money too. As he opened
the second drawer enough to see that it held writing paper and sealing wax and ink there was a
knock on the door. He walked to it and opened it a crack.
The cook said, “Fella out here wants to see ya.”
“Who is he?”
“How the hell do I know?”
Joe looked back at the room and then stepped out, took the key from the inside, locked the door,
and put the key in his pocket. He might have overlooked some-thing.
Oscar Noble was standing in the big front room, his gray hat on his head and his red mackinaw
buttoned up tight around his throat. His eyes were pale gray—the same color as his stubble
whiskers. The room was in semidarkness. No one had raised the shades yet.
Joe came lightly along the hall, and Oscar asked, “You Joe?”
“Who’s asking?”
“The sheriff wants to have a talk with you.”
Joe felt ice creeping into his stomach. “Pinch?” he asked. “Got a warrant?”

“Hell, no,” said Oscar. “We got nothing on you. Just checking up. Will you come along?”
“Sure,” said Joe. “Why not?”
They went out together. Joe shivered. “I should of got a coat.”
“Want to go back for one?”
“I guess not,” said Joe.
They walked toward Castroville Street. Oscar asked, “Ever been mugged or printed?”
Joe was quiet for a time. “Yes,” he said at last.
“What for?”
“Drunk,” said Joe. “Hit a cop.”
“Well, we’ll soon find out,” said Oscar and turned the corner.
Joe ran like a rabbit, across the street and over the track toward the stores and alleys of
Chinatown.
Oscar had to take a glove off and unbutton his mackinaw to get his gun out. He tried a snap shot
and missed.
Joe began to zigzag. He was fifty yards away by now and nearing an opening between two
buildings.
Oscar stepped to a telephone pole at the curb, braced his left elbow against it, gripped his right
wrist with his left hand, and drew a bead on the entrance to the little alley. He fired just as Joe
touched the front sight.
Joe splashed forward on his face and skidded a foot.
Oscar went into a Filipino poolroom to phone, and when he came out there was quite a crowd
around the body.

Chapter 51
1
In 1903 Horace Quinn beat Mr. R. Keef for the office of sheriff. He had been well trained as the
chief deputy sheriff. Most of the voters figured that since Quinn was doing most of the work he
might as well have the title. Sheriff Quinn held the office until 1919. He was sheriff so long that
we growing up in Monterey County thought the words “Sheriff” and “Quinn” went together
naturally. We could not imagine anyone else being sheriff. Quinn grew old in his office. He
limped from an early injury. We knew he was intrepid, for he had held his own in various
gunfights; besides, he looked like a sheriff—the only kind we knew about. His face was broad
and pink, his white mustache shaped like the horns of a longhorn steer. He was broad of shoulder,
and in his age he developed a portliness which only gave him more authority. He wore a fine
Stetson hat, a Norfolk jacket, and in his later years carried his gun in a shoulder holster. His old
belt holster tugged at his stomach too much. He had known his county in 1903 and he knew it
and controlled it even better in 1917. He was an institution, as much a part of the Salinas Valley
as its mountains.
In all the years since Adam’s shooting Sheriff Quinn had kept track of Kate. When Faye died, he
knew instinctively that Kate was probably responsible, but he also knew he hadn’t much of any
chance of convicting her, and a wise sheriff doesn’t butt his head against the impossible. They
were only a couple of whores, after all.
In the years that followed, Kate played fair with him and he gradually achieved a certain respect
for her. Since there were going to be houses anyway, they had better be run by responsible
people. Every so often Kate spotted a wanted man and turned him in. She ran a house which did
not get into trouble. Sheriff Quinn and Kate got along together.
The Saturday after Thanksgiving, about noon, Sher-iff Quinn looked through the papers from Joe
Valery’s pockets. The .38 slug had splashed off one side of Joe’s heart and had flattened against
the ribs and torn out a section as big as a fist. The manila envelopes were glued together with
blackened blood. The sheriff damp-ened the papers with a wet handkerchief to get them apart. He
read the will, which had been folded, so that the blood was on the outside. He laid it aside and
inspected the photographs in the envelopes. He sighed deeply.
Every envelope contained a man’s honor and peace of mind. Effectively used, these pictures
could cause half a dozen suicides. Already Kate was on the table at Muller’s with the formalin
running into her veins, and her stomach was in a jar in the corner’s office.
When he had seen all of the pictures he called a number. He said into the phone, “Can you drop
over to my office? Well, put your lunch off, will you? Yes, I think you’ll see it’s important. I’ll
wait for you.”

A few minutes later when the nameless man stood beside his desk in the front office of the old
red county jail behind the courthouse, Sheriff Quinn stuck the will out in front of him. “As a
lawyer, would you say this is any good?”
His visitor read the two lines and breathed deep through his nose. “Is this who I think it is?”
“Yes.”
“Well, if her name was Catherine Trask and this is her handwriting, and if Aron Trask is her son,
this is as good as gold.”
Quinn lifted the ends of his fine wide mustache with the back of his forefinger. “You knew her,
didn’t you?”
“Well, not to say know. I knew who she was.”
Quinn put his elbows on his desk and leaned for-ward. “Sit down, I want to talk to you.”
His visitor drew up a chair. His fingers picked at a coat button.
The sheriff asked, “Was Kate blackmailing you?”
“Certainly not. Why should she?”
“I’m asking you as a friend. You know she’s dead. You can tell me.”
“I don’t know what you’re getting at—nobody’s blackmailing me.”
Quinn slipped a photograph from its envelope, turned it like a playing card, and skidded it across
the desk.
His visitor adjusted his glasses and the breath whis-tled in his nose. “Jesus Christ,” he said softly.
“You didn’t know she had it?”
“Oh, I knew it all right. She let me know. For Christ’s sake, Horace—what are you going to do
with this?”
Quinn took the picture from his hand.
“Horace, what are you going to do with it?”
“Burn it.” The sheriff ruffled the edges of the enve-lopes with his thumb. “Here’s a deck of hell,”
he said. “These could tear the county to pieces.”
Quinn wrote a list of names on a sheet of paper. Then he hoisted himself up on his game leg and
went to the iron stove against the north wall of his office. He crunched up the Salinas Morning
Journal and lighted it and dropped it in the stove, and when it flared up he dropped the manila
envelopes on the flame, set the damper, and closed the stove. The fire roared and the flames
winked yellow behind the little isinglass win-dows in the front of the stove. Quinn brushed his
hands together as though they were dirty. “The negatives were in there,” he said. “I’ve been
through her desk. There weren’t any other prints.”
His visitor tried to speak but his voice was a husky whisper. “Thank you, Horace.”
The sheriff gimped to his desk and picked up his list. “I want you to do something for me. Here’s
a list. Tell everyone on this list I’ve burned the pictures. You know them all, God knows. And
they could take it from you. Nobody’s holy. Get each man alone and tell him exactly what
happened. Look here!” He opened the stove door and poked the black sheets until they were
reduced to powder. “Tell them that,” he said.
His visitor looked at the sheriff, and Quinn knew that there was no power on earth that could

keep this man from hating him. For the rest of their lives there would be a barrier between them,
and neither one could ever admit it.
“Horace, I don’t know how to thank you.”
And the sheriff said in sorrow, “That’s all right. It’s what I’d want my friends to do for me.”
“The goddam bitch,” his visitor said softly, and Horace Quinn knew that part of the curse was for
him.
And he knew he wouldn’t be sheriff much longer. These guilt-feeling men could get him out, and
they would have to. He sighed and sat down. “Go to your lunch now,” he said. “I’ve got work to
do.”
At quarter of one Sheriff Quinn turned off Main Street on Central Avenue. At Reynaud’s Bakery
he bought a loaf of French bread, still warm and giving off its wonderful smell of fermented
dough.
He used the hand rail to help himself up the steps of the Trask porch.
Lee answered the door, a dish towel tied around his middle. “He’s not home,” he said.
“Well, he’s on his way. I called the draft board. I’ll wait for him.”
Lee moved aside and let him in and seated him in the living room. “You like a nice cup of hot
coffee?” he asked.
“I don’t mind if I do.”
“Fresh made,” said Lee and went into the kitchen.
Quinn looked around the comfortable sitting room. He felt that he didn’t want his office much
longer. He remembered hearing a doctor say, “I love to deliver a baby, because if I do my work
well, there’s joy at the end of it.” The sheriff had thought often of that re-mark. It seemed to him
that if he did his work well there was sorrow at the end of it for somebody. The fact that it was
necessary was losing its weight with him. He would be retiring soon whether he wanted to or not.
Every man has a retirement picture in which he does those things he never had time to do—
makes the jour-neys, reads the neglected books he always pretended to have read. For many years
the sheriff dreamed of spend-ing the shining time hunting and fishing—wandering in the Santa
Lucia range, camping by half-remembered streams. And now that it was almost time he knew he
didn’t want to do it. Sleeping on the ground would make his leg ache. He remembered how heavy
a deer is and how hard it is to carry the dangling limp body from the place of the kill. And,
frankly, he didn’t care for venison anyway. Madame Reynaud could soak it in wine and lace it
with spice but, hell, an old shoe would taste good with that treatment.
Lee had bought a percolator. Quinn could hear the water spluttering against the glass dome, and
his long-trained mind made the suggestion that Lee hadn’t told the truth about having fresh-made
coffee.
It was a good mind the old man had—sharpened in its work. He could bring up whole faces in his
mind and inspect them, and also scenes and conversations. He could play them over like a record
or a film. Thinking of venison, his mind had gone about cata-loguing the sitting room and his
mind nudged him, say-ing, “Hey, there’s something wrong here—something strange.”
The sheriff heeded the voice and looked at the room—flowered chintz, lace curtains, white drawn-

work table cover, cushions on the couch covered with a bright and impudent print. It was a
feminine room in a house where only men lived.
He thought of his own sitting room. Mrs. Quinn had chosen, bought, cleaned, every single thing
in it except a pipestand. Come to think of it, she had bought the pipestand for him. There was a
woman’s room too. But this was a fake. It was too feminine—a woman’s room designed by a man
—and overdone, too feminine. That would be Lee. Adam wouldn’t even see it, let alone put it
together—no—Lee trying to make a home, and Adam not even seeing it.
Horace Quinn remembered questioning Adam so very long ago, remembered him as a man in
agony. He could still see Adam’s haunted and horrified eyes. He had thought then of Adam as a
man of such honesty that he couldn’t conceive anything else. And in the years he had seen much
of Adam. They both belonged to the Masonic Order. They went through the chairs together.
Horace followed Adam as Master of the Lodge and both of them wore their Past Master’s pins.
And Adam had been set apart—an invisible wall cut him off from the world. You couldn’t get
into him—he couldn’t get out to you. But in that old agony there had been no wall.
In his wife Adam had touched the living world. Horace thought of her now, gray and washed, the
needles in her throat and the rubber formalin tubes hanging down from the ceiling.
Adam could do no dishonesty. He didn’t want any-thing. You had to crave something to be
dishonest. The sheriff wondered what went on behind the wall, what pressures, what pleasures
and achings.
He shifted his behind to ease the pressure on his leg. The house was still except for the bouncing
coffee. Adam was long coming from the draft board. The amused thought came to the sheriff, I’m
getting old, and I kind of like it.
Then he heard Adam at the front door. Lee heard him too and darted into the hall. “The sheriff’s
here,” said Lee, to warn him perhaps.
Adam came in smiling and held out his hand. “Hel-lo, Horace—have you got a warrant?” It was a
damn good try at a joke.
“Howdy,” Quinn said. “Your man is going to give me a cup of coffee.”
Lee went to the kitchen and rattled dishes.
Adam said, “Anything wrong, Horace?”
“Everything’s always wrong in my business. I’ll wait till the coffee comes.”
“Don’t mind Lee. He listens anyway. He can hear through a closed door. I don’t keep anything
from him because I can’t.”
Lee came in with a tray. He was smiling remotely to himself, and when he had poured the coffee
and gone out Adam asked again, “Is there anything wrong, Horace?”
“No, I don’t think so. Adam, was that woman still married to you?”
Adam became rigid. “Yes,” he said. “What’s the matter?”
“She killed herself last night.”
Adam’s face contorted and his eyes swelled and glis-tened with tears. He fought his mouth and
then he gave up and put his face down in his hands and wept. “Oh, my poor darling!” he said.
Quinn sat quietly and let him have it out, and after a time Adam’s control came back and he

raised his head. “Excuse me, Horace,” he said.
Lee came in from the kitchen and put a damp towel in his hands, and Adam sponged his eyes and
handed it back.
“I didn’t expect that,” Adam said, and his face was ashamed. “What shall I do? I’ll claim her. I’ll
bury her.”
“I wouldn’t,” said Horace. “That is, unless you feel you have to. That’s not what I came about.”
He took the folded will from his pocket and held it out.
Adam shrank from it. “Is—is that her blood?”
“No, it’s not. It’s not her blood at all. Read it.”
Adam read the two lines and went right on staring at the paper and beyond it. “He doesn’t know—
she is his mother.”
“You never told him?”
“No.”
“Jesus Christ!” said the sheriff.
Adam said earnestly, “I’m sure he wouldn’t want anything of hers. Let’s just tear it up and forget
it. If he knew, I don’t think Aron would want anything of hers.”
“ ’Fraid you can’t,” Quinn said. “We do quite a few illegal things. She had a safe-deposit box. I
don’t have to tell you where I got the will or the key. I went to the bank. Didn’t wait for a court
order. Thought it might have a bearing.” He didn’t tell Adam he thought there might be more
pictures. “Well, Old Bob let me open the box. We can always deny it. There’s over a hundred
thousand dollars in gold certificates. There’s money in there in bales—and there isn’t one
goddam thing in there but money.”
“Nothing?”
“One other thing—a marriage certificate.”
Adam leaned back in his chair. The remoteness was coming down again, the soft protective folds
between himself and the world. He saw his coffee and took a sip of it. “What do you think I ought
to do?” he asked steadily and quietly.
“I can only tell you what I’d do,” Sheriff Quinn said. “You don’t have to take my advice. I’d have
the boy in right now. I’d tell him everything—every single thing. I’d even tell him why you
didn’t tell him before. He’s—how old?”
“Seventeen.”
“He’s a man. He’s got to take it some time. Better if he gets the whole thing at once.”
“Cal knows,” said Adam. “I wonder why she made the will to Aron?”
“God knows. Well, what do you think?”
“I don’t know, and so I’m going to do what you say. Will you stay with me?”
“Sure I will.”
“Lee,” Adam called, “tell Aron I want him. He has come home, hasn’t he?”
Lee came to the doorway. His heavy lids closed for a moment and then opened. “Not yet. Maybe
he went back to school.”
“He would have told me. You know, Horace, we drank a lot of champagne on Thanksgiving.

Where’s Cal?”
“In his room,” said Lee.
“Well, call him. Get him in. Cal will know.”
Cal’s face was tired and his shoulders sagged with exhaustion, but his face was pinched and
closed and crafty and mean.
Adam asked, “Do you know where your brother is?”
“No, I don’t,” said Cal.
“Weren’t you with him at all?”
“No.”
“He hasn’t been home for two nights. Where is he?”
“How do I know?” said Cal. “Am I supposed to look after him?”
Adam’s head sank down, his body jarred, just a little quiver. In back of his eyes a tiny sharp
incredibly bright blue light flashed. He said thickly, “Maybe he did go back to college.” His lips
seemed heavy and he murmured like a man talking in his sleep. “Don’t you think he went back to
college?”
Sheriff Quinn stood up. “Anything I got to do I can do later. You get a rest, Adam. You’ve had a
shock.”
Adam looked up at him. “Shock—oh, yes. Thank you, George. Thank you very much.”
“George?”
“Thank you very much,” said Adam.
When the sheriff had gone, Cal went to his room. Adam leaned back in his chair, and very soon
he went to sleep and his mouth dropped open and he snored across his palate.
Lee watched him for a while before he went back to his kitchen. He lifted the breadbox and took
out a tiny volume bound in leather, and the gold tooling was almost completely worn away—The
Meditations of Marcus Aurelius in English translation.
Lee wiped his steel-rimmed spectacles on a dish towel. He opened the book and leafed through.
And he smiled to himself, consciously searching for reassur-ance.
He read slowly, moving his lips over the words. “Everything is only for a day, both that which
remem-bers and that which is remembered.
“Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom thyself to consider that
the nature of the universe loves nothing so much as to change things which are and to make new
things like them. For everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be.”
Lee glanced down the page. “Thou wilt die soon and thou are not yet simple nor free from perturbations, nor without suspicion of being hurt by external things, nor kindly disposed towards all;
nor dost thou yet place wisdom only in acting justly.”
Lee looked up from the page, and he answered the book as he would answer one of his ancient
relatives. “That is true,” he said. “It’s very hard. I’m sorry. But don’t forget that you also say,
‘Always run the short way and the short way is the natural’—don’t forget that.” He let the pages
slip past his fingers to the fly leaf where was written with a broad carpenter’s pencil, “Sam’l
Hamilton.”

Suddenly Lee felt good. He wondered whether Sam’l Hamilton had ever missed his book or
known who stole it. It had seemed to Lee the only clean pure way was to steal it. And he still felt
good about it. His fingers caressed the smooth leather of the binding as he took it back and
slipped it under the breadbox. He said to him-self, “But of course he knew who took it. Who else
would have stolen Marcus Aurelius?”He went into the sitting room and pulled a chair near to the
sleeping Adam.

In his room Cal sat at his desk, elbows down, palms holding his aching head together, hands
pushing against the sides of his head. His stomach churned and the sour-sweet smell of whisky
was on him and in him, living in his pores, in his clothing, beating sluggishly in his head.
Cal had never drunk before, had never needed to. But going to Kate’s had been no relief from
pain and his revenge had been no triumph. His memory was all swirling clouds and broken pieces
of sound and sight and feeling. What now was true and what was imagined he could not separate.
Coming out of Kate’s he had touched his sobbing brother and Aron had cut him down with a fist
like a whip. Aron had stood over him in the dark and then suddenly turned and ran, screaming
like a brokenhearted child. Cal could still hear the hoarse cries over running footsteps. Cal had
lain still where he had fallen under the tall privet in Kate’s front yard. He heard the engines
puffing and snorting by the roundhouse and the crash of freight cars being assembled. Then he
had closed his eyes and, hearing light steps and feeling a presence, he looked up. Someone was
bending over him and he thought it was Kate. The figure moved quietly away.
After a while Cal had stood up and brushed himself and walked toward Main Street. He was
surprised at how casual his feeling was. He sang softly under his breath, “There’s a rose that
grows in no man’s land and ‘tis wonderful to see—”
On Friday Cal brooded the whole day long. And in the evening Joe Laguna bought the quart of
whisky for him. Cal was too young to purchase. Joe wanted to accompany Cal, but Joe was
satisfied with the dollar Cal gave him and went back for a pint of grappa.
Cal went to the alley behind the Abbot House and found the shadow behind a post where he had
sat the night he first saw his mother. He sat cross-legged on the ground, and then, in spite of
revulsion and nausea, he forced the whisky into himself. Twice he vomited and then went on
drinking until the earth tipped and swayed and the streetlight spun majestically in a circle.
The bottle slipped from his hand finally and Cal passed out, but even unconscious he still
vomited weakly. A serious, short-haired dog-about-town with a curling tail sauntered into the
alley, making his sta-tions, but he smelled Cal and took a wide circle around him. Joe Laguna
found him and smelled him too. Joe shook the bottle leaning against Cal’s leg and Joe held it up
to the streetlight and saw that it was one-third full. He looked for the cork and couldn’t find it. He
walked away, his thumb over the neck to keep the whisky from sloshing out.
When in the cold dawn a frost awakened Cal to a sick world he struggled home like a broken bug.
He hadn’t far to go, just to the alley mouth and then across the street.
Lee heard him at the door and smelled his nastiness as he bumped along the hall to his room and

fell over on his bed. Cal’s head shattered with pain and he was wide awake. He had no resistance
against sorrow and no device to protect himself against shame. After a while he did the best he
could. He bathed in icy water and scrubbed and scratched his body with a block of pumice stone,
and the pain of his scraping seemed good to him.
He knew that he had to tell his guilt to his father and beg his forgiveness. And he had to humble
himself to Aron, not only now but always. He could not live without that. And yet, when he was
called out and stood in the room with Sheriff Quinn and his father, he was as raw and angry as a
surly dog and his hatred of himself turned outward toward everyone—a vicious cur he was,
unloved, unloving.
Then he was back in his room and his guilt assaulted him and he had no weapon to fight it off.
A panic for Aron arose in him. He might be in-jured, might be in trouble. It was Aron who
couldn’t take care of himself. Cal knew he had to bring Aron back, had to find him and build him
back the way he had been. And this had to be done even though Cal sacrificed himself. And then
the idea of sacrifice took hold of him the way it does with all guilty-feeling men. A sacrifice
might reach Aron and bring him back.
Cal went to his bureau and got the flat package from under his handkerchiefs in his drawer. He
looked around the room and brought a porcelain pin tray to his desk. He breathed deeply and
found the cool air good tasting. He lifted one of the crisp bills, creased it in the middle so’ that it
made an angle, and then he scratched a match under his desk and lighted the bill. The heavy
paper curled and blackened, the flame ran upward, and only when the fire was about his
fingertips did Cal drop the charred chip in the pin tray. He stripped off another bill and lighted it.
When six were burned Lee came in without knock-ing. “I smelled smoke,” and then he saw what
Cal was doing. “Oh!” he said.
Cal braced himself for intervention but none came. Lee folded his hands across his middle and
stood silent-ly—waiting. Cal doggedly lighted bill after bill until all were burned, and then he
crushed the black chips down to powder and waited for Lee to comment, but Lee did not speak or
move.
At last Cal said, “Go ahead—you want to talk to me. Go ahead!”
“No,” said Lee, “I don’t. And if you have no need to talk to me—I’ll stay a while and then I’ll go
away. I’ll sit down here.” He squatted in a chair, folded his hands, and waited. He smiled to
himself, the expression that is called inscrutable.
Cal turned from him. “I can outsit you,” he said.
“In a contest maybe,” said Lee. “But in day to day, year to year—who knows?—century to
century sitting—no, Cal. You’d lose.”
After a few moments Cal said peevishly, “I wish you’d get on with your lecture.”
“I don’t have a lecture.”
“What the hell are you doing here then? You know what I did, and I got drunk last night.”
“I suspect the first and I can smell the second.”
“Smell?”
“You still smell,” said Lee.

“First time,” said Cal. “I don’t like it.”
“I don’t either,” said Lee. “I’ve got a bad stomach for liquor. Besides it makes me playful,
intellectual but playful.”
“How do you mean, Lee?”
“I can only give you an example. In my younger days I played tennis. I liked it, and it was also a
good thing for a servant to do. He could pick up his master’s flubs at doubles and get no thanks
but a few dollars for it. Once, I think it was sherry that time, I developed the theory that the
fastest and most elusive animals in the world are bats. I was apprehended in the middle of the
night in the bell tower of the Methodist Church in San Leandro. I had a racquet, and I seem to
have explained to the arresting officer that I was improving my backhand on bats.”
Cal laughed with such amusement that Lee almost wished he had done it.
Cal said, “I just sat behind a post and drank like a pig.”
“Always animals—”
“I was afraid if I didn’t get drunk I’d shoot myself, Cal interrupted.
“You’d never do that. You’re too mean,” said Lee. “By the way, where is Aron?”
“He ran away. I don’t know where he went. “He’s not too mean,” said Lee nervously. “I know it.
That’s what I thought about. You don’t think he would, do you, Lee?”
Lee said testily, “Goddam it, whenever a person wants reassurance he tells a friend to think what
he wants to be true. It’s like asking a waiter what’s good tonight. How the hell do I know?”
Cal cried, “Why did I do it—why did I do it?”
“Don’t make it complicated,” Lee said. You know why you did it. You were mad at him, and you
were mad at him because your father hurt your feelings. That’s not difficult. You were just mean.”
“I guess that’s what I wonder—why I’m mean. Lee, I don’t want to be mean. Help me, Lee!”
“Just a second,” Lee said. “I thought I heard your father.” He darted out the door.
Cal heard voices for a moment and then Lee came back to the room. “He’s going to the post
office. We never get any mail in midafternoon. Nobody does. But every man in Salinas goes to
the post office in the afternoon.”
“Some get a drink on the way, said Cal. “I guess it is a kind of a habit and a kind of a rest. They
see their friends.” And Lee said, “Cal—I don’t like your father’s looks. He’s got a dazed look.
Oh, I forgot. You don’t know. Your mother committed suicide last night.”
Cal said, “Did she?” and then he snarled, I hope it hurt. No, I don’t want to say that. I don’t want
to think that. There it is again. There it is! I don’t—want it—Lee scratched a spot on his head,
and that started his whole head to itching, and he scratched it all over, taking his time. It gave him
the appearance of deep thought. He said, “Did burning the money give you much pleasure?”
“I—I guess so.”
“And are you taking pleasure from this whipping you’re giving yourself? Are you enjoying your
despair?”
“Lee!”
“You’re pretty full of yourself. You’re marveling at the tragic spectacle of Caleb Trask—Caleb
the mag-nificent, the unique. Caleb whose suffering should have its Homer. Did you ever think of

yourself as a snot-nose kid—mean sometimes, incredibly generous some-times? Dirty in your
habits, and curiously pure in your mind. Maybe you have a little more energy than most, just
energy, but outside of that you’re very like all the other snot-nose kids. Are you trying to attract
dignity and tragedy to yourself because your mother was a whore? And if anything should have
happened to your brother, will you be able to sneak for yourself the eminence of being a
murderer, snot-nose?”
Cal turned slowly back to his desk. Lee watched him, holding his breath the way a doctor
watches for the reaction to a hypodermic. Lee could see the reac-tions flaring through Cal—the
rage at insult, the bellig-erence, and the hurt feelings following behind and out of that—just the
beginning of relief.
Lee sighed. He had worked so hard, so tenderly, and his work seemed to have succeeded. He said
softly, “We’re a violent people, Cal. Does it seem strange to you that I include myself? Maybe
it’s true that we are all descended from the restless, the nervous, the crimi-nals, the arguers and
brawlers, but also the brave and independent and generous. If our ancestors had not been that,
they would have stayed in their home plots in the other world and starved over the squeezed-out
soil.”
Cal turned his head toward Lee, and his face had lost its tightness. He smiled, and Lee knew he
had not fooled the boy entirely. Cal knew now it was a job—a well-done job—and he was
grateful.
Lee went on, “That’s why I include myself. We all have that heritage, no matter what old land
our fathers left. All colors and blends of Americans have some-what the same tendencies. It’s a
breed—selected out by accident. And so we’re overbrave and overfearful—we’re kind and cruel
as children. We’re overfriendly and at the same time frightened of strangers. We boast and are
impressed. We’re oversentimental and realistic. We are mundane and materialistic—and do you
know of any other nation that acts for ideals? We eat too much. We have no taste, no sense of
proportion. We throw our energy about like waste. In the old lands they say of us that we go from
barbarism to decadence without an intervening culture. Can it be that our critics have not the key
or the language of our culture? That’s what we are, Cal—all of us. You aren’t very different.”
“Talk away,” said Cal, and he smiled and repeated, “Talk away.”
“I don’t need to any more,” said Lee. “I’m finished now. I wish your father would come back. He
worries me.” And Lee went nervously out.
In the hall just inside the front door he found Adam leaning against the wall, his hat low over his
eyes and his shoulders slumped.
“Adam, what’s the matter with you?”
“I don’t know. Seem tired. Seem tired.”
Lee took him by the arm, and it seemed that he had to guide him toward the living room. Adam
fell heavily into his chair, and Lee took the hat from his head. Adam rubbed the back of his left
hand with his right. His eyes were strange, very clear but unmoving. And his lips were dry and
thickened and his speech had the sound of a dream talker, slow and coming from a distance. He
rubbed his hand harshly. “Strange thing,” he said, “I must have fainted—in the post office. I

never faint. Mr. Pioda helped me up. Just for a second it was, I guess. I never faint.”
Lee asked, “Was there any mail?”
“Yes—yes—I think there was mail.” He put his left hand in his pocket and in a moment took it
out. “My hand is kind of numb,” he said apologetically and reached across with his right hand
and brought out a yellow government postcard.
“Thought I read it,” he said. “I must have read it.” He held it up before his eyes and then dropped
the card in his lap. “Lee, I guess I’ve got to get glasses. Never needed them in my life. Can’t read
it. Letters jump around.”
“Shall I read it?”
“Funny—well, I’ll go first thing for glasses. Yes, what does it say?”
And Lee read,” ‘Dear Father, I’m in the army. I told them I was eighteen. I’ll be all right. Don’t
worry about me. Aron.’ ”
“Funny,” said Adam. “Seems like I read it. But I guess I didn’t.” He rubbed his hand.

Chapter 52
1
That winter of 1917-1918 was a dark and frightened time. The Germans smashed everything in
front of them. In three months the British suffered three hun-dred thousand casualties. Many units
of the French army were mutinous. Russia was out of the war. The German east divisions, rested
and re-equipped, were thrown at the western front. The war seemed hopeless.
It was May before we had as many as twelve divi-sions in the field, and summer had come before
our troops began to move across the sea in numbers. The Allied generals were fighting each
other. Submarines slaughtered the crossing ships.
We learned then that war was not a quick heroic charge but a slow, incredibly complicated
matter. Our spirits sank in those winter months. We lost the flare of excitement and we had not
yet put on the doggedness of a long war.
Ludendorff was unconquerable. Nothing stopped him. He mounted attack after attack on the
broken armies of France and England. And it occurred to us that we might be too late, that soon
we might be standing alone against the invincible Germans.
It was not uncommon for people to turn away from the war, some to fantasy and some to vice and
some to crazy gaiety. Fortunetellers were in great demand, and saloons did a roaring business.
But people also turned inward to their private joys and tragedies to escape the pervasive fear and
despondency. Isn’t it strange that today we have forgotten this? We remember World War I as
quick victory, with flags and bands, marching and horseplay and returning soldiers, fights in the
bar-rooms with the goddam Limeys who thought they had won the war. How quickly we forgot
that in that winter Ludendorff could not be beaten and that many people were preparing in their
minds and spirits for a lost war.

2
Adam Trask was more puzzled than sad. He didn’t have to resign from the draft board. He was
given a leave of absence for ill health. He sat by the hour rubbing the back of his left hand. He
brushed it with a harsh brush and soaked it in hot water.
“It’s circulation,” he said. “As soon as I get the circulation back it’ll be all right. It’s my eyes that
bother me. I never had trouble with my eyes. Guess I’ll have to get my eyes tested for glasses. Me
with glasses! Be hard to get used to. I’d go today but I feel a little dizzy.”
He felt more dizzy than he would admit. He could not move about the house without a hand brace
against a wall. Lee often had to give him a hand-up out of his chair or help him out of bed in the
morning and tie his shoes because he could not tie knots with his numb left hand.
Almost daily he came back to Aron. “I can under-stand why a young man might want to enlist,”
he said. “If Aron had talked to me, I might have tried to persuade him against it, but I wouldn’t

have forbidden it. You know that, Lee.”
“I know it.”
“That’s what I can’t understand. Why did he sneak away? Why doesn’t he write? I thought I
knew him better than that. Has he written to Abra? He’d be sure to write to her.”
“I’ll ask her.”
“You do that. Do that right away.”
“The training is hard. That’s what I’ve heard. Maybe they don’t give him time.”
“It doesn’t take any time to write a card.”
“When you went in the army, did you write to your father?”
“Think you’ve got me there, don’t you? No, I didn’t, but I had a reason. I didn’t want to enlist.
My father forced me. I was resentful. You see, I had a good reason. But Aron—he was doing fine
in college. Why, they’ve written, asking about him. You read the letter. He didn’t take any
clothes. He didn’t take the gold watch.”
“He wouldn’t need any clothes in the army, and they don’t want gold watches there either.
Everything’s brown.”
“I guess you’re right. But I don’t understand it. I’ve got to do something about my eyes. Can’t
ask you to read everything to me.” His eyes really troubled him. “I can see a letter,” he said. “But
the words jumble all around.” A dozen times a day he seized a paper or a book and stared at it
and put it down.
Lee read the papers to him to keep him from getting restless, and often in the middle of the
reading Adam went to sleep.
He would awaken and say, “Lee? Is that you, Cal? You know I never had any trouble with my
eyes. I’ll just go tomorrow and get my eyes tested.”
About the middle of February Cal went into the kitchen and said, “Lee, he talks about it all the
time. Let’s get his eyes tested.”
Lee was stewing” apricots. He left the stove and closed the kitchen door and went back to the
stove. “I don’t want him to go,” he said.
“Why not?”
“I don’t think it’s his eyes. Finding out might trouble him. Let him be for a while. He’s had a bad
shock. Let him get better. I’ll read to him all he wants.”
“What do you think it is?”
“I don’t want to say. I’ve thought maybe Dr. Ed-wards might just come by for a friendly call—
just to say hello.”
“Have it your own way,” said Cal.
Lee said, “Cal, have you seen Abra?”
“Sure, I see her. She walks away.”
“Can’t you catch her?”
“Sure—and I could throw her down and punch her in the face and make her talk to me. But I
won’t.”
“Maybe if you’d just break the ice. Sometimes the barrier is so weak it just falls over when you

touch it. Catch up with her. Tell her I want to see her.”
“I won’t do it.”
“You feel awful guilty, don’t you?”
Cal did not answer.
“Don’t you like her?”
Cal did not answer.
“If you keep this up, you’re going to feel worse, not better. You’d better open up. I’m warning
you. You’d better open up.”
Cal cried, “Do you want me to tell Father what I did? I’ll do it if you tell me to.”
“No, Cal. Not now. But when he gets well you’ll have to. You’ll have to for yourself. You can’t
carry this alone. It will kill you.”
“Maybe I deserve to be killed.”
“Stop that!” Lee said coldly. “That can be the cheapest kind of self-indulgence. You stop that!”
“How do you go about stopping it?” Cal asked.
Lee changed the subject. “I don’t understand why Abra hasn’t been here—not even once.”
“No reason to come now.”
“It’s not like her. Something’s wrong there. Have you seen her?”
Cal scowled. “I told you I have. You’re getting crazy too. Tried to talk to her three times. She
walked away.”
“Something’s wrong. She’s a good woman—a real woman.”
“She’s a girl,” said Cal. “It sounds funny you calling her a woman.”
“No,” Lee said softly. “A few are women from the moment they’re born. Abra has the loveliness
of wom-an, and the courage—and the strength—and the wis-dom. She knows things and she
accepts things. I would have bet she couldn’t be small or mean or even vain ex-cept when it’s
pretty to be vain.”
“You sure do think well of her.”
“Well enough to think she wouldn’t desert us.” And he said, “I miss her. Ask her to come to see
me.”
“I told you she walked away from me.”
“Well, chase her then. Tell her I want to see her. I miss her.”
Cal asked, “Shall we go back to my father’s eyes now?”
“No,” said Lee.
“Shall we talk about Aron?”
“No.”

3
Cal tried all the next day to find Abra alone, and it was only after school that he saw her ahead of
him, walking home. He turned a corner and ran along the parallel street and then back, and he
judged time and distance so that he turned in front of her as she strolled along.
“Hello,” he said.

“Hello. I thought I saw you behind me.”
“You did. I ran around the block to get in front of you. I want to talk to you.”
She regarded him gravely. “You could have done «that without running around the block.”
“Well, I tried to talk to you in school. You walked away.”
“You were mad. I didn’t want to talk to you mad.”
“How do you know I was?”
“I could see it in your face and the way you walked. You’re not mad now.”
“No, I’m not.”
“Do you want to take my books?” She smiled.
A warmth fell on him. “Yes—yes, I do.” He put her schoolbooks under his arm and walked
beside her. “Lee wants to see you. He asked me to tell you.”
She was pleased. “Does he? Tell him I’ll come. How’s your father?”
“Not very well. His eyes bother him.”
They walked along in silence until Cal couldn’t stand it any more. “You know about Aron?”
“Yes.” She paused. “Open my binder and look next to the first page.”
He shifted the books. A penny postcard was in the binder. “Dear Abra,” it said. “I don’t feel
clean. I’m not fit for you. Don’t be sorry. I’m in the army. Don’t go near my father. Good-by,
Aron.”
Cal snapped the book shut. “The son of a bitch,” he said under his breath.
“What?”
“Nothing.”
“I heard what you said.”
“Do you know why he went away?”
“No. I guess I could figure out—put two and two together. I don’t want to. I’m not ready to—that
is, unless you want to tell me.”
Suddenly Cal said, “Abra—do you hate me?”
“No, Cal, but you hate me a little. Why is that?”
“I—I’m afraid of you.”
“No need to be.”
“I’ve hurt you more than you know. And you’re my brother’s girl.”
“How have you hurt me? And I’m not your brother’s girl.”
“All right,” he said bitterly, “I’ll tell you—and I don’t want you to forget you asked me to. Our
mother was a whore. She ran a house here in town. I found out about it a long time ago.
Thanksgiving night I took Aron down and showed her to him. I—”
Abra broke in excitedly, “What did he do?”
“He went mad—just crazy. He yelled at her. Outside he knocked me down and ran away. Our
dear mother killed herself; my father—he’s—there’s something wrong with him. Now you know
about me. Now you have some reason to walk away from me.”
“Now I know about him,” she said calmly.
“My brother?”

“Yes, your brother.”
“He was good. Why did I say was? He is good. He’s not mean or dirty like me.”
They had been walking very slowly. Abra stopped and Cal stopped and she faced him.
“Cal,” she said, “I’ve known about your mother for a long, long time.”
“You have?”
“I heard my parents talking when they thought I was asleep. I want to tell you something, and it’s
hard to tell and it’s good to tell.”
“You want to?”
“I have to. It’s not so terribly long ago that I grew up and I wasn’t a little girl any more. Do you
know what I mean?”
“Yes,” said Cal.
“You sure you know?”
“Yes.”
“All right then. It’s hard to say now. I wish I’d said it then. I didn’t love Aron any more.”
“Why not?”
“I’ve tried to figure it out. When we were children we lived in a story that we made up. But when
I grew up the story wasn’t enough. I had to have something else, because the story wasn’t true
any more.”
“Well—”
“Wait—let me get it all out. Aron didn’t grow up. Maybe he never will. He wanted the story and
he wanted it to come out his way. He couldn’t stand to have it come out any other way.”
“How about you?”
“I don’t want to know how it comes out. I only want to be there while it’s going on. And, Cal—
we were kind of strangers. We kept it going because we were used to it. But I didn’t believe the
story any more.”
“How about Aron?”
“He was going to have it come out his way if he had to tear the world up by the roots.”
Cal stood looking at the ground.
Abra said, “Do you believe me?”
“I’m trying to study it out.”
“When you’re a child you’re the center of every-thing. Everything happens for you. Other
people? They’re only ghosts furnished for you to talk to. But when you grow up you take your
place and you’re your own size and shape. Things go out of you to others and come in from other
people. It’s worse, but it’s much better too. I’m glad you told me about Aron.”
“Why?”
“Because now I know I didn’t make it all up. He couldn’t stand to know about his mother
because that’s not how he wanted the story to go—and he wouldn’t have any other story. So he
tore up the world. It’s the same way he tore me up—Abra—when he wanted to be a priest.”
Cal said, “I’ll have to think.”
“Give me my books,” she said. “Tell Lee I’ll come. I feel free now. I want to think too. I think I

love you, Cal.”
“I’m not good.”
“Because you’re not good.”
Cal walked quickly home. “She’ll come tomorrow,” he told Lee.
“Why, you’re excited,” said Lee.

4
Once in the house Abra walked on her toes. In the hall she moved close to the wall where the
floor did not creak. She put her foot on the lowest step of the car-peted stairs, changed her mind,
and went to the kitchen.
“Here you are,” her mother said. “You didn’t come straight home.”
“I had to stay after class. Is Father better?”
“I guess so.”
“What does the doctor say?”
“Same thing he said at first—overwork. Just needs a rest.”
“He hasn’t seemed tired,” said Abra.
Her mother opened a bin and took out three baking potatoes and carried them to the sink. “Your
Father’s very brave, dear. I should have known. He’s been doing so much war work on top of his
own work. The doctor says sometimes a man collapses all at once.”
“Shall I go in and see him?”
“You know, Abra, I’ve got a feeling that he doesn’t want to see anybody. Judge Knudsen phoned
and your father said to tell him he was asleep.”
“Can I help you?”
“Go change your dress, dear. You don’t want to get your pretty dress soiled.
Abra tiptoed past her father’s door and went to her own room. It was harsh bright with varnish,
papered brightly. Framed photographs of her parents on the bureau, poems framed on the walls,
and her closet—everything in its place, the floor varnished, and her shoes standing diligently side
by side. Her mother did everything for her, insisted on it—planned for her, dressed her.
Abra had long ago given up having any private things in her room, even any personal thing. This
was of such long standing that Abra did not think of her room as a private place. Her privacies
were of the mind. The few letters she kept were in the sitting room itself, filed among the pages
of the two-volume Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, which to the best of her knowledge had never
been opened by anyone but herself since it came off the press.
Abra felt pleased, and she did not inspect the reason. She knew certain things without question,
and such things she did not speak about. For example, she knew that her father was not ill. He
was hiding from some-thing. Just as surely she knew that Adam Trask was ill, for she had seen
him walking along the street. She won-dered whether her mother knew her father was not ill.
Abra slipped off her dress and put on a cotton pinafore, which was understood to be for working
around the house. She brushed her hair, tiptoed past her father’s room, and went downstairs. At
the foot of the stairs she opened her binder and took out Aron’s postcard. In the sitting room she

shook Aron’s letters out of Volume II of the Memoirs, folded them tightly, and, raising her skirt,
tucked them under the elastic which held up her panties. The package made her a little lumpy. In
the kitchen she put on a full apron to conceal the bulge.
“You can scrape the carrots,” her mother said. “Is that water hot?”
“Just coming to a boil.”
“Drop a bouillon cube in that cup, will you, dear? The doctor says it’ll build your father up.”
When her mother carried the steaming cup upstairs, Abra opened the incinerator end of the gas
stove, put in the letters, and lighted them.
Her mother came back, saying, “I smell fire.”
“I lit the trash. It was full.”
“I wish you’d ask me when you want to do a thing like that,” her mother said. “I was saving the
trash to warm the kitchen in the morning.”
“I’m sorry, Mother,” Abra said. “I didn’t think.”
“You should try to think of these things. It seems to me you’re getting very thoughtless lately.”
“I’m sorry, Mother.”
“Saved is earned,” said her mother.
The telephone rang in the dining room. Her mother went to answer it. Abra heard her mother say,
“No, you can’t see him. It’s doctor’s orders. He can’t see anyone—no, not anyone.”
She came back to the kitchen. “Judge Knudsen again,” she said.

All during school next day Abra felt good about going to see Lee. She met Cal in the hall
between classes. “Did you tell him I was coming?”
“He’s started some kind of tarts,” said Cal. He was dressed in his uniform—choking high collar,
ill-fitting tunic, and wrapped leggings.
“You’ve got drill,” Abra said. “I’ll get there first. What kind of tarts?”
“I don’t know. But leave me a couple, will you? Smelled like strawberry. Just leave me two.”
“Want to see a present I got for Lee? Look!” She opened a little cardboard box. “It’s a new kind
of potato peeler. Takes off just the skin. It’s easy. I got it for Lee.”
“There go my tarts,” said Cal, and then, “If I’m a little late, don’t go before I get there, will you?”
“Would you like to carry my books home?”
“Yes,” said Cal.
She looked at him long, full in the eyes, until he wanted to drop his gaze, and then she walked
away toward her class.

Adam had taken to sleeping late, or, rather, he had taken to sleeping very often—short sleeps
during the night and during the day. Lee looked in on him several times before he found him
awake.
“I feel fine this morning,” Adam said.
“If you can call it morning. It’s nearly eleven o’clock.”
“Good Lord! I have to get up.”
“What for?” Lee asked.
“What for? Yes, what for! But I feel good, Lee. I might walk down to the draft board. How is it
out-side?”
“Raw,” said Lee.
He helped Adam get up. Buttons and shoelaces and getting things on frontways gave Adam
trouble.
While Lee helped him Adam said, “I had a dream—very real. I dreamed about my father.”
“A great old gentleman from all I hear,” said Lee. “I read that portfolio of clippings your
brother’s lawyer sent. Must have been a great old gentleman.”
Adam looked calmly at Lee. “Did you know he was a thief?”
“You must have had a dream,” said Lee. “He’s buried at Arlington. One clipping said the Vice
Pres-ident was at his funeral, and the Secretary of War. You know the Salinas Index might like to
do a piece about him—in wartime, you know. How would you like to go over the material?”

“He was a thief,” said Adam. “I didn’t think so once, but I do now. He stole from the G.A.R.”
“I don’t believe it,” said Lee.
There were tears in Adam’s eyes. Very often these days tears came suddenly to Adam. Lee said,
“Now you sit right here and I’ll bring you some breakfast. Do you know who’s coming to see us
this afternoon? Abra.”
Adam said, “Abra?” and then, “Oh, sure, Abra. She’s a nice girl.”
“I love her,” said Lee simply. He got Adam seated in front of the card table in his bedroom.
“Would you like to work on the cutout puzzle while I get your breakfast?”
“No, thank you. Not this morning. I want to think about the dream before I forget it.”
When Lee brought the breakfast tray Adam was asleep in his chair. Lee awakened him and read
the Salinas Journal to him while he ate and then helped him to the toilet.
The kitchen was sweet with tarts, and some of the berries had boiled over in the oven and burned,
making the sharp, bitter-sweet smell pleasant and astringent.
There was a quiet rising joy in Lee. It was the joy of change. Time’s drawing down for Adam, he
thought. Time must be drawing down for me, but I don’t feel it. I feel immortal. Once when I was
very young I felt mortal—but not any more. Death has receded. He wondered if this were a
normal way to feel.
And he wondered what Adam meant, saying his father was a thief. Part of the dream, maybe. And
then Lee’s mind played on the way it often did. Suppose it were true—Adam, the most rigidly
honest man it was possible to find, living all his life on stolen money. Lee laughed to himself—
now this second will, and Aron, whose purity was a little on the self-indulgent side, living all his
life on the profits from a whorehouse. Was this some kind of joke or did things balance so that if
one went too far in one direction an automatic slide moved on the scale and the balance was reestablished?
He thought of Sam Hamilton. He had knocked on so many doors. He had the most schemes and
plans, and no one would give him any money. But of course—he had so much, he was so rich.
You couldn’t give him any more. Riches seem to come to the poor in spirit, the poor in interest
and joy. To put it straight—the very rich are a poor bunch of bastards. He wondered if that were
true. They acted that way sometimes.
He thought of Cal burning the money to punish himself. And the punishment hadn’t hurt him as
badly as the crime. Lee said to himself, “If there should happen to be a place where one day I’ll
come up with Sam Hamilton, I’ll have a lot of good stories to tell him,” and his mind went on,
“But so will he!”
Lee went in to Adam and found him trying to open the box that held the clippings about his father.

3
The wind blew cold that afternoon. Adam insisted on going to look in on the draft board. Lee
wrapped him up and started him off. “If you feel faint at all, just sit down wherever you are,” Lee
said.
“I will,” Adam agreed. “I haven’t felt dizzy all day. Might stop in and have Victor look at my

eyes.”
“You wait till tomorrow. I’ll go with you.”
“We’ll see,” said Adam, and he started out, swinging his arms with bravado.
Abra came in with shining eyes and a red nose from the frosty wind, and she brought such
pleasure that Lee giggled softly when he saw her.
“Where are the tarts?” she demanded. “Let’s hide them from Cal.” She sat down in the kitchen.
“Oh, I’m so glad to be back.”
Lee started to speak and choked and then what he wanted to say seemed good to say—to say
carefully. He hovered over her. “You know, I haven’t wished for many things in my life,” he
began. “I learned very early not to wish for things. Wishing just brought earned disappointment.”
Abra said gaily, “But you wish for something now. What is it?”
He blurted out, “I wish you were my daughter—” He was shocked at himself. He went to the
stove and turned out the gas under the teakettle, then lighted it again.
She said softly, “I wish you were my father.”
He glanced quickly at her and away. “You do?”
“Yes, I do.”
“Why?”
“Because I love you.”
Lee went quickly out of the kitchen. He sat in his room, gripping his hands tightly together until
he stopped choking. He got up and took a small carved ebony box from the top of his bureau. A
dragon climbed toward heaven on the box. He carried the box to the kitchen and laid it on the
table between Abra’s hands. “This is for you,” he said, and his tone had no inflection.
She opened the box and looked down on a small, dark green jade button, and carved on its
surface was a human right hand, a lovely hand, the fingers curved and in repose. Abra lifted the
button out and looked at it, and then she moistened it with the tip of her tongue and moved it
gently over her full lips, and pressed the cool stone against her cheek.
Lee said, “That was my mother’s only ornament.”
Abra got up and put her arms around him and kissed him on the cheek, and it was the only time
such a thing had ever happened in his whole life.
Lee laughed. “My Oriental calm seems to have deserted me,” he said. “Let me make the tea,
darling. I’ll get hold of myself that way.” From the stove he said, “I’ve never used that word—
never once to any-body in the world.”
Abra said, “I woke up with joy this morning.”
“So did I,” said Lee. “I know what made me feel happy. You were coming.”
“I was glad about that too, but—”
“You are changed,” said Lee. “You aren’t any part a little girl any more. Can you tell me?”
“I burned all of Aron’s letters.”
“Did he do bad things to you?”
“No. I guess not. Lately I never felt good enough. I always wanted to explain to him that I was
not good.”

“And now that you don’t have to be perfect, you can be good. Is that it?”
“I guess so. Maybe that’s it.”
“Do you know about the mother of the boys?”
“Yes. Do you know I haven’t tasted a single one of the tarts?” Abra said. “My mouth is dry.”
“Drink some tea, Abra. Do you like Cal?”
“Yes.”
Lee said, “He’s crammed full to the top with every good thing and every bad thing. I’ve thought
that one single person could almost with the weight of a finger—”
Abra bowed her head over her tea. “He asked me to go to the Alisal when the wild azaleas
bloom.”
Lee put his hands on the table and leaned over. “I don’t want to ask you whether, you are going,”
he said.
“You don’t have to,” said Abra. “I’m going.”
Lee sat opposite her at the table. “Don’t stay away from this house for long,” he said.
“My father and mother don’t want me here.”
“I only saw them once,” Lee said cynically. “They seemed to be good people. Sometimes, Abra,
the strang-est medicines are effective. I wonder if it would help if they knew Aron has just
inherited over a hundred thou-sand dollars.”
Abra nodded gravely and fought to keep the corners of her mouth from turning up. “I think it
would help,” she said. “I wonder how I could get the news to them.”
“My dear,” said Lee, “if I heard such a piece of news I think my first impulse would be to
telephone someone. Maybe you’d have a bad connection.”
Abra nodded. “Would you tell her where the money came from?”
“That I would not,” said Lee.
She looked at the alarm clock hung on a nail on the wall. “Nearly five,” she said. “I’ll have to go.
My father isn’t well. I thought Cal might get back from drill.”
“Come back very soon,” Lee said.

4
Cal was on the porch when she came out.
“Wait for me,” he said, and he went into the house and dropped his books.
“Take good care of Abra’s books,” Lee called from the kitchen.
The winter night blew in with frosty wind, and the street lamps with their sputtering carbons
swung rest-lessly and made the shadows dart back and forth like a runner trying to steal second
base. Men coming home from work buried their chins in their overcoats and hurried toward
warmth. In the still night the monot-onous scattering music of the skating rink could be heard
from many blocks away.
Cal said, “Will you take your books for a minute, Abra? I want to unhook this collar. It’s cutting
my head off.” He worked the hooks out of the. eyes and sighed with relief. “I’m all chafed,” he
said and took her books back. The branches of the big palm tree in Berges’s front yard were

lashing with a dry clatter, and a cat meowed over and over and over in front of some kitchen door
closed against it.
Abra said, “I don’t think you make much of a soldier. You’re too independent.”
“I could be,” said Cal. “This drilling with old Krag-Jorgensens seems silly to me. When the time
comes, and I take an interest, I’ll be good.”
“The tarts were wonderful,” said Abra. “I left one for you.”
“Thanks. I’ll bet Aron makes a good soldier.”
“Yes, he will—and the best-looking soldier in the army. When are we going for the azaleas?”
“Not until spring.”
“Let’s go early and take a lunch.”
“It might be raining.”
“Let’s go anyway, rain or shine.”
She took her books and went into her yard. “See you tomorrow,” she said.
He did not turn toward home. He walked in the nervous night past the high school and past the
skating rink—a floor with a big tent over it, and a mechanical orchestra clanging away. Not a
soul was skating. The old man who owned it sat miserably in his booth, flip-ping the end of a roll
of tickets against his forefinger.
Main Street was deserted. The wind skidded papers on the sidewalk. Tom Meek, the constable,
came out of Bell’s candy store and fell into step with Cal. “Better hook that tunic collar, soldier,”
he said softly.
“Hello, Tom. The damn thing’s too tight.”
“I don’t see you around the town at night lately.”
“No.”
“Don’t tell me you reformed.”
“Maybe.”
Tom prided himself on his ability to kid people and make it sound serious. He said, “Sounds like
you got a girl.”
Cal didn’t answer.
“I heard your brother faked his age and joined the army. Are you picking off his girl?”
“Oh, sure—sure,” said Cal.
Tom’s interest sharpened. “I nearly forgot,” he said. “I hear Will Hamilton is telling around you
made fifteen thousand dollars in beans. That true?”
“Oh, sure,” said Cal.
“You’re just a kid. What are you going to do with all that money?”
Cal grinned at him. “I burned it up.”
“How do you mean?”
“Just set a match to it and burned it.”
Tom looked into his face. “Oh, yeah! Sure. Good thing to do. Got to go in here. Good night.”
Tom Meek didn’t like people to kid him. “The young punk son of a bitch,” he said to himself.
“He’s getting too smart for himself.”

Cal moved slowly along Main Street, looking in store windows. He wondered where Kate was
buried. If he could find out, he thought he might take a bunch of flowers, and he laughed at
himself for the impulse. Was it good or was he fooling himself? The Salinas wind would blow
away a tombstone, let along a bunch of carnations. For some reason he remembered the Mex-ican
name for carnations. Somebody must have told him when he was a kid. They were called Nails of
Love—and marigolds, the Nails of Death. It was a word like nails—claveles. Maybe he’d better
put marigolds on his mother’s grave. “I’m beginning to think like Aron,” he said to himself.

Chapter 54

The winter seemed reluctant to let go its bite. It hung on cold and wet and windy long after its
time. And people repeated, “It’s those damned big guns they’re shooting off in France—spoiling
the weather in the whole world.”
The grain was slow coming up in the Salinas Valley, and the wildflowers came so late that some
people thought they wouldn’t come at all.
We knew—or at least we were confident—that on May Day, when all the Sunday School picnics
took place in the Alisal, the wild azaleas that grew in the skirts of the stream would be in bloom.
They were a part of May Day.
May Day was cold. The picnic was drenched out of existence by a freezing rain, and there wasn’t
an-open blossom on the azalea trees. Two weeks later they still weren’t out.
Cal hadn’t known it would be like this when he had made azaleas the signal for his picnic, but
once the symbol was set it could not be violated.
The Ford sat in Windham’s shed, its tires pumped up, and with two new dry cells to make it start
easily on Bat. Lee was alerted to make sandwiches when the day came, and he got tired of
waiting and stopped buying sandwich bread every two days.
“Why don’t you just go anyway?” he said.
“I can’t,” said Cal. “I said azaleas.”
“How will you know?”
“The Silacci boys live out there, and they come into school every day. They say it will be a week
or ten days.”
“Oh, Lord!” said Lee. “Don’t overtrain your picnic.”
Adam’s health was slowly improving. The numbness was going from his hand. And he could
read a little—a little more each day.
“It’s only when I get tired that the letters jump,” he said. “I’m glad I didn’t get glasses to ruin my
eyes. I knew my eyes were all right.”
Lee nodded and was glad. He had gone to San Francisco for the books he needed and had written
for a number of separates. He knew about as much as was known about the anatomy of the brain
and the symp-toms and severities of lesion and thrombus. He had studied and asked questions
with the same unwavering intensity as when he had trapped and pelted and cured a Hebrew verb.
Dr. H. C. Murphy had got to know Lee very well and had gone from a professional impatience
with a Chinese servant to a genuine admira-tion for a scholar. Dr. Murphy had even borrowed
some of Lee’s news separates and reports on diagnosis and practice. He told Dr. Edwards, “That
Chink knows more about the pathology of cerebral hemorrhage than I do, and I bet as much as

you do.” He spoke with a kind of affectionate anger that this should be so. The medical
profession is unconsciously irritated by lay knowledge.
When Lee reported Adam’s improvement he said, “It does seem to me that the absorption is
continuing—”
“I had a patient,” Dr. Murphy said, and he told a hopeful story.
“I’m always afraid of recurrence,” said Lee.
“That you have to leave with the Almighty,” said Dr. Murphy. “We can’t patch an artery like an
inner tube. By the way, how do you get him to let you take his blood pressure?”
“I bet on his and he bets on mine. It’s better than horse racing.”
“Who wins?”
“Well, I could,” said Lee. “But I don’t. That would spoil the game—and the chart.”
“How do you keep him from getting excited?”
“It’s my own invention,” said Lee. “I call it conver-sational therapy.”
“Must take all your time.”
“It does,” said Lee.

On May 28, 1918, American troops carried out their first important assignment of World War I.
The First Division, General Bullard commanding, was ordered to capture the village of Cantigny.
The village, on high ground, dominated the Avre River valley. It was de-fended by trenches,
heavy machine guns, and artillery. The front was a little over a mile wide.
At 6:45 A.M., May 28, 1918, the attack was begun after one hour of artillery preparation. Troops
involved were the 28th Infantry (Col. Ely), one battalion of the 18th Infantry (Parker), a company
of the First Engi-neers, the divisional artillery (Summerall), and a sup-port of French tanks and
flame throwers.
The attack was a complete success. American troops entrenched on the new line and repulsed two
powerful German counterattacks.
The First Division received the congratulations of Clemenceau, Foch, and Pétain.

3
It was the end of May before the Silacci boys brought the news that the salmon-pink blossoms of
the azaleas were breaking free. It was on a Wednesday, as the nine o’clock bell was ringing, that
they told him.
Cal rushed to the English classroom, and just as Miss Norris took her seat on the little stage he
waved his handkerchief and blew his nose loudly. Then he went down to the boys’ toilet and
waited until he heard through the wall the flush of water on the girlside. He went out through the
basement door, walked close to the red brick wall, slipped around the pepper tree, and, once out
of sight of the school, walked slowly along until Abra caught up with him.
“When’d they come out?” she asked.
“This morning.”
“Shall we wait till tomorrow?”

He looked up at the gay yellow sun, the first earth-warming sun of the year. “Do you want to
wait?”
“No,” she said.
“Neither do I.”
They broke into a run—bought bread at Reynaud’s and joggled Lee into action.
Adam heard loud voices and looked into the kitchen. “What’s the hullabaloo?” he asked.
“We’re going on a picnic,” said Cal.
“Isn’t it a school day?”
Abra said, “Sure it is. But it’s a holiday too.”
Adam smiled at her. “You’re pink as a rose,” he said.
Abra cried, “Why don’t you come along with us? We’re going to the Alisal to get azaleas.”
“Why, I’d like to,” Adam said, and then, “No, I can’t. I promised to go down to the ice plant.
We’re putting in some new tubing. It’s a beautiful day.”
“We’ll bring you some azaleas,” Abra said.
“I like them. Well, have a good time.”
When he was gone Cal said, “Lee, why don’t you come with us?”
Lee looked sharply at him. “I hadn’t thought you were a fool,” he said.
“Come on!” Abra cried.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Lee.

4
It’s a pleasant little stream that gurgles through the Alisal against the Gabilan Mountains on the
east of the Salinas Valley. The water bumbles over round stones and washes the polished roots of
the trees that hold it in.
The smell of azaleas and the sleepy smell of sun working with chlorophyll filled the air. On the
bank the Ford car sat, still breathing softly from its overheating. The back seat was piled with
azalea branches.
Cal and Abra sat on the bank among the luncheon papers. They dangled their feet in the water.
“They always wilt before you get them home,” said Cal.
“But they’re such a good excuse, Cal,” she said. “If you won’t I guess I’ll have to—”
“What?”
She reached over and took his hand. “That,” she said.
“I was afraid to.”
“Why?”
“I don’t know.”
“I wasn’t.”
“I guess girls aren’t afraid of near as many things.”
“I guess not.”
“Are you ever afraid?”
“Sure,” she said. “I was afraid of you after you said I wet my pants.”

“That was mean,” he said. “I wonder why I did it,” and suddenly he was silent.
Her fingers tightened around his hand. “I know what you’re thinking. I don’t want you to think
about that.”
Cal looked at the curling water and turned a round brown stone with his toe.
Abra said, “You think you’ve got it all, don’t you? You think you attract bad things—”
“Well—”
“Well, I’m going to tell you something. My father’s in trouble.”
“How in trouble?”
“I haven’t been listening at doors but I’ve heard enough. He’s not sick. He’s scared. He’s done
some-thing.”
He turned his head. “What?”
“I think he’s taken some money from his company. He doesn’t know whether his partners are
going to put him in jail or let him try to pay it back.”
“How do you know?”
“I heard them shouting in his bedroom where he’s sick. And my mother started the phonograph to
drown them out.”
He said, “You aren’t making it up?”
“No. I’m not making it up.”
He shuffled near and put his head against her shoul-der and his arm crept timidly around her
waist.
“You see, you’re not the only one—” She looked sideways at his face. “Now I’m afraid,” she said
weakly.

5
At three o’clock in the afternoon Lee was sitting at his desk, turning over the pages of a seed
catalogue. The pictures of sweet peas were in color.
“Now these would look nice on the back fence. They’d screen off the slough. I wonder if there’s
enough sun.” He looked up at the sound of his own voice and smiled to himself. More and more
he caught himself speaking aloud when the house was empty.
“It’s age,” he said aloud. “The slowing thoughts and—” He stopped and grew rigid for a moment.
“That’s funny—listening for something. I wonder whether I left the teakettle on the gas. No—I
remem-ber.” He listened again. “Thank heaven I’m not super-stitious. I could hear ghosts walk if
I’d let myself. I could—”
The front doorbell rang.
“There it is. That’s what I was listening for. Let it ring. I’m not going to be led around by
feelings. Let it ring.”
But it did not ring again.
A black weariness fell on Lee, a hopelessness that pressed his shoulders down. He laughed at
himself. “I can go and find it’s an advertisement under the door or I can sit here and let my silly
old mind tell me death is on the doorstep. Well, I want the advertisement.”

Lee sat in the living room and looked at the enve-lope in his lap. And suddenly he spat at it. “All
right,” he said. “I’m coming—goddam you,” and he ripped it open and in a moment laid it on the
table and turned it over with the message down.
He stared between his knees at the floor. “No,” he said, “that’s not my right. Nobody has the right
to remove any single experience from another. Life and death are promised. We have a right to
pain.”
His stomach contracted. “I haven’t got the courage. I’m a cowardly yellow belly. I couldn’t stand
it.”
He went into the bathroom and measured three teaspoons of elixir of bromide into a glass and
added water until the red medicine was pink. He carried the glass to the living room and put it on
the table. He folded the telegram and shoved it in his pocket. He said aloud, “I hate a coward!
God, how I hate a coward!” His hands were shaking and a cold perspiration damp-ened his
forehead.
At four o’clock he heard Adam fumbling at the doorknob. Lee licked his lips. He stood up and
walked slowly to the hall. He carried the glass of pink fluid and his hand was steady.

Chapter 55

All of the lights were on in the Trask house. The door stood partly open, and the house was cold.
In the sit-ting room Lee was shriveled up like a leaf in the chair beside the lamp. Adam’s door
was open and the sound of voices came from his room.
When Cal came in he asked, “What’s going on?”
Lee looked at him and swung his head toward the table where the open telegram lay. “Your
brother is dead,” he said. “Your father has had a stroke.”
Cal started down the hall.
Lee said, “Come back. Dr. Edwards and Dr. Mur-phy are in there. Let them alone.”
Cal stood in front of him. “How bad? How bad, Lee, how bad?”
“I don’t know.” He spoke as though recalling an ancient thing. “He came home tired. But I had to
read him the telegram. That was his right. For about five minutes he said it over and over to
himself out loud. And then it seemed to get through into his brain and to explode there.”
“Is he conscious?”
Lee said wearily, “Sit down and wait, Cal. Sit down and wait. Get used to it. I’m trying to.”
Cal picked up the telegram and read its bleak and dignified announcement.
Dr. Edwards came out, carrying his bag. He nodded curtly, went out, and closed the door smartly
behind him.
Dr. Murphy set his bag on the table and sat down. He sighed. “Dr. Edwards asked me to tell you.”
“How is he?” Cal demanded.
“I’ll tell you all we know. You’re the head of the family now, Cal. Do you know what a stroke
is?” He didn’t wait for Cal to answer. “This one is a leakage of blood in the brain. Certain areas
of the brain are affect-ed. There have been earlier smaller leakages. Lee knows that.”
“Yes,” said Lee.
Dr. Murphy glanced at him and then back at Cal. “The left side is paralyzed. The right side partly.
Prob-ably there is no sight in the left eye, but we can’t determine that. In other words, your father
is nearly helpless.”
“Can he talk?”
“A little—with difficulty. Don’t tire him.”
Cal struggled for words. “Can he get well?”
“I’ve heard of reabsorption cases this bad but I’ve never seen one.”
“You mean he’s going to die?”
“We don’t know. He might live for a week, a month, a year, even two years. He might die
tonight.”

“Will he know me?”
“You’ll have to find that out for yourself. I’ll send a nurse tonight and then you’ll have to get
permanent nurses.” He stood up. “I’m sorry, Cal. Bear up! You’ll have to bear up.” And he said,
“It always surprises me how people bear up.” They always do. Edwards will be in tomorrow.
Good night.” He put his hand out to touch Cal’s shoulder, but Cal moved away and walked
toward his father’s room.
Adam’s head was propped up on pillows. His face was calm, the skin pale; the mouth was
straight, neither smiling nor disapproving. His eyes were open, and they had great depth and
clarity, as though one could see deep into them and as though they could see deep into their
surroundings. And the eyes were calm, aware but not interested. They turned slowly toward Cal
as he entered the room, found his chest, and then rose to his face and stayed there.
Cal sat down in the straight chair beside the bed. He said, “I’m sorry, Father.”
The eyes blinked slowly the way a frog blinks.
“Can you hear me, Father? Can you understand me?” The eyes did not change or move. “I did it,”
Cal cried. “I’m responsible for Aron’s death and for your sickness. I took him to Kate’s. I showed
him his mother. That’s why he went away. I don’t want to do bad things—but I do them.”
He put his head down on the side of the bed to escape the terrible eyes, and he could still see
them. He knew they would be with him, a part of him, all of his life.
The doorbell rang. In a moment Lee came to the bedroom, followed by the nurse—a strong,
broad wom-an with heavy black eyebrows. She opened breeziness as she opened her suitcase.
“Where’s my patient! There he is! Why, you look fine! What am I doing here? Maybe you better
get up and take care of me, you look good. Would you like to take care of me, big handsome
man?” She thrust a muscular arm under Adam’s shoulder and effortlessly hoisted him toward the
head of the bed and held him up with her right arm while with her left she patted out the pillows
and laid him back.
“Cool pillows,” she said. “Don’t you love cool pil-lows? Now, where’s the bathroom? Have you
got a duck and a bedpan? Can you put a cot in here for me?”
“Make a list,” said Lee. “And if you need any help—with him—”
“Why would I need help? We’ll get along just fine, won’t we, sugar-sweetie?”
Lee and Cal retired to the kitchen. Lee said, “Before she came I was going to urge you to have
some supper—you know, like the kind of person who uses food for any purpose good or bad? I
bet she’s that way. You can eat or not eat, just as you wish.”
Cal grinned at him. “If you’d tried to make me, I’d have been sick. But since you put it that way,
I think I’ll make a sandwich.”
“You can’t have a sandwich.”
“I want one.”
“It all works out,” said Lee, “true to outrageous form. It’s kind of insulting that everyone reacts
about the same way.”
“I don’t want a sandwich,” Cal said. “Are there any tarts left?”
“Plenty—in the breadbox. They may be a little soaky.”

“I like them soaky,” Cal said. He brought the whole plate to the table and set it in front of him.
The nurse looked into the kitchen. “These look good,” she said and took one, bit into it, and
talked among her chewings. “Can I phone Krough’s drugstore for the things I need? Where’s the
phone? Where do you keep the linen? Where’s the cot you’re going to bring in? Are you through
with this paper? Where did you say the phone is?” She took another tart and retired.
Lee asked softly, “Did he speak to you?”
Cal shook his head back and forth as though he couldn’t stop.
“It’s going to be dreadful. But the doctor is right. You can stand anything. We’re wonderful
animals that way.”
“I am not.” Cal’s voice was flat and dull. “I can’t stand it. No, I can’t stand it. I won’t be able to.
I’ll have to—I’ll have to—”
Lee gripped his wrist fiercely. “Why, you mouse—you nasty cur. With goodness all around you—
don’t you dare suggest a thing like that! Why is your sorrow more refined than my sorrow?”
“It’s not sorrow. I told him what I did. I killed my brother. I’m a murderer. He knows it.”
“Did he say it? Tell the truth—did he say it?”
“He didn’t have to. It was in his eyes. He said it with his eyes. There’s nowhere I can go to get
away—there’s no place.”
Lee sighed and released his wrist. “Cal”—he spoke patiently—“listen to me. Adam’s brain
centers are affected. Anything you see in his eyes may be pressure on that part of his brain which
governs his seeing. Don’t you remember?—he couldn’t read. That wasn’t his eyes—that was
pressure. You don’t know he accused you. You don’t know that.”
“He accused me. I know it. He said I’m a mur-derer.”
“Then he will forgive you. I promise.”
The nurse stood in the doorway. “What are you promising, Charley? You promised me a cup of
coffee.”
“I’ll make it now. How is he?”
“Sleeping like a baby. Have you got anything to read in this house?”
“What would you like?”
“Something to take my mind off my feet.”
“I’ll bring the coffee to you. I’ve got some dirty stories written by a French queen. They might be
too—”
“You bring ’em with the coffee,” she said. “Why don’t you get some shuteye, sonny? Me and
Charley’ll hold the fort. Don’t forget the book, Charley.”
Lee set the percolator on the gas jet. He came to the table and said, “Cal!”
“What do you want?”
“Go to Abra.”

Cal stood on the neat porch and kept his finger on the bell until the harsh overlight flashed on and
the night bolt rasped and Mrs. Bacon looked out. “I want to see Abra,” Cal said.

Her mouth dropped open in amazement. “You want what?”
“I want to see Abra.”
“You can’t. Abra’s gone to her room. Go away.”
Cal shouted, “I tell you I want to see Abra.”
“You go away or I’ll call the police.”
Mr. Bacon called, “What is it? Who is it?”
“Never you mind—go back to bed. You aren’t well. I’ll handle this.”
She turned back to Cal. “Now you get off the porch. And if you ring the bell again I’ll phone the
police. Now, get!” The door slammed, the bolt scraped, and the hard overlight went off.
Cal stood smiling in the dark for he thought of Tom Meek lumbering up, saying, “Hello, Cal.
What you up to?”
Mrs. Bacon shouted from inside. “I see you. Go on now! Get off the porch!”
He walked slowly down the walk and turned toward home, and he hadn’t gone a block before
Abra caught up with him. She was panting from her run. “Got out the back way,” she said.
“They’ll find you gone.”
“I don’t care.”
“You don’t?”
“No.”
Cal said, “Abra, I’ve killed my brother and my father is paralyzed because of me.”
She took his arm and clung to it with both hands.
Cal said, “Didn’t you hear me?”
“I heard you.”
“Abra, my mother was a whore.”
“I know. You told me. My father is a thief.”
“I’ve got her blood, Abra. Don’t you understand?”
“I’ve got his,” she said.
They walked along in silence while he tried to rebal-ance himself. The wind was cold, and they
quickened their steps to keep warm. They passed the last street-light on the very edge of Salinas,
and blackness lay ahead of them and the road was unpaved and sticky with black ’dobe mud.
They had come to the end of the pavement, to the end of the streetlights. The road under their feet
was slippery with spring mud, and the grass that brushed against their legs was wet with dew.
Abra asked, “Where are we going?”
“I wanted to run away from my father’s eyes. They’re right in front of me all the time. When I
close my eyes I still see them. I’ll always see them. My father is going to die, but his eyes will
still be looking at me, telling me I killed my brother.”
“You didn’t.”
“Yes, I did. And his eyes say I did.”
“Don’t talk like that. Where are we going?”
“A little farther. There’s a ditch and a pump house—and a willow tree. Do you remember the
willow tree?”

“I remember it.”
He said, “The branches come down like a tent and their tips touch the ground.”
“I know.”
“In the afternoons—the sunny afternoons—you and Aron would part the branches and go inside—
and no one could see you.”
“You watched?”
“Oh, sure. I watched.” And he said, “I want you to go inside the willow tree with me. That’s what
I want to do.”
She stopped and her hand pulled him to a stop. “No,” she said. “That’s not right.”
“Don’t you want to go in with me?”
“Not if you’re running away—no, I don’t.”
Cal said, “Then I don’t know what to do. What shall I do? Tell me what to do.”
“Will you listen?”
“I don’t know.”
“We’re going back,” she said.
“Back? Where?”
“To your father’s house,” said Abra.

The light of the kitchen poured down on them. Lee had lighted the oven to warm the chilly air.
“She made me come,” said Cal.
“Of course she did. I knew she would.”
Abra said, “He would have come by himself.”
“We’ll never know that,” said Lee.
He left the kitchen and in a moment he returned. “He’s still sleeping.” Lee set a stone bottle and
three little translucent porcelain cups on the table.
“I remember that,” said Cal.
“You ought to.” Lee poured the dark liquor. “Just sip it and let it run around your tongue.”
Abra put her elbows on the kitchen table. “Help him,” she said. “You can accept things, Lee.
Help him.”
“I don’t know whether I can accept things or not,” Lee said. “I’ve never had a chance to try. I’ve
always found myself with some—not less uncertain but less able to take care of uncertainty. I’ve
had to do my weeping—alone.”
“Weeping? You?”
He said, “When Samuel Hamilton died the world went out like a candle. I relighted it to see his
lovely creations, and I saw his children tossed and torn and destroyed as though some
vengefulness was at work. Let the ng-ka-py run back on your tongue.”
He went on, “I had to find out my stupidities for myself. These were my stupidities: I thought the
good are destroyed while the evil survive and prosper.
“I thought that once an angry and disgusted God poured molten fire from a crucible to destroy or

to purify his little handiwork of mud.
“I thought I had inherited both the scars of the fire and the impurities which made the fire
necessary—all inherited, I thought. All inherited. Do you feel that way?”
“I think so,” said Cal.
“I don’t know,” Abra said.
Lee shook his head. “That isn’t good enough. That isn’t good enough thinking. Maybe—” And
he was silent.
Cal felt the heat of the liquor in his stomach. “Maybe what, Lee?”
“Maybe you’ll come to know that every man in every generation is refired. Does a craftsman,
even in his old age, lose his hunger to make a perfect cup—thin, strong, translucent?” He held his
cup to the light. “All impurities burned out and ready for a glorious flux, and for that—more fire.
And then either the slag heap or, perhaps what no one in the world ever quite gives up,
perfection,” He drained his cup and he said loudly, “Cal, listen to me. Can you think that
whatever made us—would stop trying?”
“I can’t take it in,” Cal said. “Not now I can’t.”
The heavy steps of the nurse sounded in the living room. She billowed through the door and she
looked at Abra, elbows on the table, holding her cheeks between her palms.
The nurse said, “Have you got a pitcher? They get thirsty. I like to keep a pitcher of water handy.
You see,” she explained, “they breathe through their mouths.”
“Is he awake?” Lee asked. “There’s a pitcher.”
“Oh, yes, he’s awake and rested. And I’ve washed his face and combed his hair. He’s a good
patient. He tried to smile at me.”
Lee stood up. “Come along, Cal. I want you to come too, Abra. You’ll have to come.”
The nurse filled her pitcher at the sink and scurried ahead of them.
When they trooped into the bedroom Adam was propped high on his pillows. His white hands lay
palms down on either side of him, and the sinews from knuckle to wrist were tight drawn. His
face was waxen, and his sharp features were sharpened. He breathed slowly between pale lips.
His blue eyes reflected back the night light focused on his head.
Lee and Cal and Abra stood at the foot of the bed, and Adam’s eyes moved slowly from one face
to the other, and his lips moved just a little in greeting.
The nurse said, “There he is. Doesn’t he look nice? He’s my darling. He’s my sugar pie.
“Hush!” said Lee.
“I won’t have you tiring my patient.”
“Go out of the room,” said Lee.
“I’ll have to report this to the doctor.”
Lee whirled toward her. “Go out of the room and close the door. Go and write your report.”
“I’m not in the habit of taking orders from Chinks.”
Cal said, “Go out now, and close the door.”
She slammed the door just loud enough to register her anger. Adam blinked at the sound.
Lee said, “Adam!”

The blue wide eyes looked for the voice and finally found Lee’s brown and shining eyes.
Lee said, “Adam, I don’t know what you can hear or understand. When you had the numbness in
your hand and your eyes refused to read, I found out everything I could. But some things no one
but you can know. You may, behind your eyes, be alert and keen, or you may be living in a
confused gray dream. You may, like a newborn child, perceive only light and movement.
“There’s damage in your brain, and it may be that you are a new thing in the world. Your
kindness may be meanness now, and your bleak honesty fretful and conniving. No one knows
these things except you. Adam! Can you hear me?”
The blue eyes wavered, closed slowly, then opened.
Lee said, “Thank you, Adam. I know how hard it is. I’m going to ask you to do a much harder
thing. Here is your son—Caleb—your only son. Look at him, Adam!”
The pale eyes looked until they found Cal. Cal’s mouth moved dryly and made no sound.
Lee’s voice cut in, “I don’t know how long you will live, Adam. Maybe a long time. Maybe an
hour. But your son will live. He will marry and his children will be the only remnant left of you.”
Lee wiped his eyes with his fingers.
“He did a thing in anger, Adam, because he thought you had rejected him. The result of his anger
is that his brother and your son is dead.”
Cal said, “Lee—you can’t.”
“I have to,” said Lee. “If it kills him I have to. I have the choice,” and he smiled sadly and
quoted, “ ‘If there’s blame, it’s my blame.’ ” Lee’s shoulders straight-ened. He said sharply,
“Your son is marked with guilt out of himself—out of himself—almost more than he can bear.
Don’t crush him with rejection. Don’t crush him, Adam.”
Lee’s breath whistled in his throat. “Adam, give him your blessing. Don’t leave him alone with
his guilt. Adam, can you hear me? Give him your blessing!”
A terrible brightness shone in Adam’s eyes and he closed them and kept them closed. A wrinkle
formed between his brows.
Lee said, “Help him, Adam—help him. Give him his chance. Let him be free. That’s all a man
has over the beasts. Free him! Bless him!”
The whole bed seemed to shake under the concentra-tion. Adam’s breath came quick with his
effort and then, slowly, his right hand lifted—lifted an inch and then fell back.
Lee’s face was haggard. He moved to the head of the bed and wiped the sick man’s damp face
with the edge of the sheet. He looked down at the closed eyes. Lee whispered, “Thank you, Adam
—thank you, my friend. Can you move your lips? Make your lips form his name.”
Adam looked up with sick weariness. His lips parted and failed and tried again. Then his lungs
filled. He expelled the air and his lips combed the rushing sigh. His whispered word seemed to
hang in the air:
“Timshel!”
His eyes closed and he slept.
